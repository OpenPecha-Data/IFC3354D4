<h3>The History of the Great Jarung Kashor StÅ«pa</h3>
<p><strong><em>by Padmasambhava<br/>
Discovered by LhatsÃ¼n NgÃ¶nmo and<br/>
Rediscovered by Ngakchang ÅÄkya Zangpo</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>Emaho</em>!</p>
<p>DharmakÄyaÂ AmitÄbha, Boundless Light,<br/>
Saá¹bhogakÄyaÂ MahÄkÄruá¹ika, the Great Compassionate One,<br/>
NirmÄá¹akÄyaÂ PadmÄkara, the Lotus-BornÂ â<br/>
Three <em>kÄya</em> lineage gurus, to you I pay homage! </p>
<p>This is the story of the GreatÂ Jarung Kashor StÅ«pa, support for the <em>dharmakÄya</em>, indivisible from the wisdom-mind of all buddhas and bodhisattvas, in all the ten directions, past, present and still to come.</p>
<p>On the tenth day of the Monkey month of the maleÂ Fire Monkey year, in the middle storey of the great monastery of Glorious SamyÃ©, the Unchanging, Spontaneously Accomplished, aÂ grandÂ empowerment for <em>The Guruâs Utterly Secret Heart Practice</em><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>Â was being conferredÂ to theÂ Dharma King and theÂ twenty-five disciples.Â  </p>
<p>On this occasion,Â the disciples requested theÂ Precious Master of Uá¸á¸iyÄna to take a seat upon nine brocadeÂ cushions. Offering him a golden goblet filled with wine, they invited him to enjoy an assortment of all kindsÂ of foods. ThenÂ they offered him twenty-one pieces ofÂ turquoise, the most splendid of which was from the kingâs own neck and known asÂ âRadiant Lamp.â<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> They also presented five measures of gold dust, seven gold bricks, one hundredÂ bolts of fine silk, and countless other goods and enjoyments.Â  </p>
<p>The King, Trisong Deutsen then prostrated himself one hundred times, and said:Â </p>
<blockquote>
<p>âO great master!Â Though bornÂ in this uncivilizedÂ country of Tibet, land of red-faced demons, I have succeeded in invitingÂ AbbotÂ Bodhisattva of the land of Zahor, and the scholar PadmÄkara of the land of Uá¸á¸iyÄna, both of whom are genuine <em>nirmÄá¹akÄya</em> emanations. In accordance withÂ my solemnÂ vow, we have completed thisÂ support for beings to gather merit â aÂ residence for the Three PreciousÂ Jewels, this great monastery of GloriousÂ SamyÃ©, the Unchanging, Spontaneously Accomplished, which is unrivalled by any in southern JambudvÄ«pa! Now this uncivilized land of Tibet, which was like a darkened isle, sees the teachings of the Three Jewels spreading like the risingÂ sun upon theÂ snow-cappedÂ mountains.<br/>
âPray, tellÂ us how this golden age has comeÂ to pass,Â an era whenÂ all beingsÂ listenÂ to and expound the holy Dharma, just like inÂ the central land of Magadha. Tell us how,Â during the time of theÂ TathÄgata KÄÅyapaâs teachings, in the Maguta district of Nepal, teacher and disciples alikeÂ were born as theÂ four sons ofÂ aÂ poor poultry-woman,Â and how they builtÂ the Jarung Kashor StÅ«pa. How did they come toÂ build the <em>stÅ«pa</em>, and what types of aspirations did they make? IfÂ you tell us how this present age is the fruition of our past aspirations, then confidence, faith and inspiration will grow. Please, then,Â recount this for usÂ in great detail!&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the king had spoken thus, the MahÄguru offered his reply: âO, great king,Â listen carefully and remember itÂ all!â</p>
<h4>Chapter 1: Construction and Consecration</h4>
<p>âWhat followsÂ is theÂ history of the Great Jarung Kashor StÅ«pa. Countless eonsÂ ago, beyond measure, the Bodhisattva, theÂ MahÄsattva, Noble AvalokiteÅvara made an aspiration in the presence of the TathÄgata AmitÄbha â to liberate all beings from the swamps of cyclic existence.Â AfterÂ rescuing countless wanderingÂ beings from saá¹sÄraâs ocean, he returned to his palace on the peak of Potala Mountain, thinking, âNow thereâs not a single sentient being left.â But when he looked out, he saw that theÂ beings of the six realms hadnât lessened in number at all: they were as numerous as the left-overÂ grains at the bottom of a brewing cask. âI must beÂ completely incapable of rescuing beingsÂ from the ocean of saá¹sÄra!â he thought,Â and he began to cry. Wiping a tearÂ with each of his ring fingers, he flicked themÂ away with the prayer,Â âIn the future, may these twoÂ tears benefit wandering beings!âÂ  </p>
<p>âAt that time, in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, two daughters were born to Indra, theÂ King of Gods â royal goddesses by the names ofÂ PÅ«rá¹Ä and LittleÂ PÅ«rá¹Ä. But Little PÅ«rá¹Ä transgressed the impeccable lawÂ of the realm by stealing a divine flower, and so was cast down into the human realm. There she was born into a family of poultry-farmers in the Maguta district of theÂ Kathmandu Valley, in Nepal. The name of her father wasÂ PrabhÄsvara, and herÂ mother was PÅ«rá¹Ä. They called her SamvarÄ«, andÂ together theyÂ raised chickens. </p>
<p>âLater,Â SamvarÄ« gave birth to four sons from lying withÂ four outcast men. The father of her eldest childÂ was a horse-keeper, the second a swineherd, the third a dog-keeper, and the fourth child was born from her stay with another poultry farmer. As their mother, she savedÂ what she earned from raising chickens and managed to set up her sons as respectableÂ householders. On top of this, her remainingÂ savings amounted to quite aÂ fortune, so a thought arose in her mind: âWell, now I have set up my four sons as respectable householders with the money Iâve saved raising chickens, I have some money left over. I will put this wealth to good use. I will build a support for the wisdom-mind of all the buddhas, my own <em>yidam</em>, a place for beings to accumulate immeasurable merit, a great <em>stÅ«pa</em> whose essence is the TathÄgatasâÂ relics. First things first,Â I must go and request theÂ great king of this country for aÂ grant ofÂ land.âÂ  </p>
<p>âArriving in the presence of the great king, she prostrated, circumambulated and,Â kneeling with palms together, supplicated: âO great king! Though I am but a poor, single poultry-woman, I have raised four sons, born of four fathers, and, with my earnings from raising chickens, I have set themÂ up as respectable householders. The money left over amounts to quite a fortune, and so I request that I may build a place where beings may accumulate immeasurable merit, my own <em>yidam</em>, a support for the wisdom-mind of all the buddhas, a great <em>stÅ«pa</em> which holds the essence of the TathÄgatasâ relics. Please grant me [a parcel of land to do so]!â </p>
<p>âGreat kings do not make their decisions without due examination, so for a moment he sat in contemplation and thought, âThis poor, single, poultry-womanÂ brought up four sons born of four fathers, with the earnings from raising chickens, and set them up as respectable householders. Now she wishes to build a great <em>stÅ«pa</em> with the money left over â this isÂ truly amazing!â and, as this thought arose in his mind, he declared,Â âLet it be doneÂ (<em>Jarung</em>)!â The poultry woman leapt withÂ joy and utter delight, and again she prostrated herself and circumambulated many times, and then returned home.Â  </p>
<p>âSo the mother, her four sons, and a single servant all loaded upÂ anÂ elephant and a donkey with bricks and delivered them to the site, where they began buildingÂ the foundations for the great <em>stÅ«pa</em>. Once it was three tiers high, theÂ Newar people began to confer amongst themselves: âIf this poor, single poultry-woman can build a <em>stÅ«pa</em> like this, then what kind of <em>stÅ«pa</em> shouldÂ the king, his ministers, the wealthy and the powerful seek to build? Theyâll all be ridiculed and censured!â They decided to requestÂ the great king toÂ withdraw his agreement and call a halt to the building. And so it was that the Newar folk all gathered together and made their request: âO great king, you have made a grave mistake! If this poor, single poultry-woman makes such a <em>stÅ«pa</em>, then what kind of <em>stÅ«pa</em>, what kind of support for gathering the roots of merit will be left for all you powerful folk to build â you the king, your ministers, the wealthy and so on? If this construction continues, then each and every one of you will be harshly criticised. Get the stones removed and taken back to where they came from! Agree that the building must go on no longer!â</p>
<p>âThe great king duly gave his reply: âAll of you, listen carefully! This poor, single poultry-woman, through gathering earnings fromÂ raising chickens, established her four sons born of four fathers as respectable householders. Not only that, with her remaining wealth she builds a <em>stÅ«pa</em> such as this. I thought this to be truly amazing, and so the words âLet it be doneâ (<em>jarung</em>) slipped from my tongue (<em>kashor</em>). KingsÂ speak but once!â </p>
<p>So, although these people tried, they were not able to prevent the construction. Thus the <em>stÅ«pa</em> became known by the name Jarung Kashor. (âLet it be done, Slip of the tongueâ) </p>
<p>âThereafter, the building continued, summer and winter without cease, and, four years later, everything up toÂ the dome was completed. At that time, SamvarÄ« theÂ poultry woman realized that her life had almost reached itsÂ end, so she spoke toÂ her four sons and their servant: âYou all, continue to buildÂ this field for theÂ infinitely countless, wandering sentient beingsÂ toÂ accumulate merit, my <em>yidam</em>, thisÂ great <em>stÅ«pa</em>,Â supreme above all! Please, place the relics of the TathÄgatas within, and perform an elaborate consecration. Not only will thisÂ fulfill myÂ wish, but the enlightened intent ofÂ all the buddhas of the three times will be fulfilled to perfection. You will also accomplish something vastly meaningful for this and future lives as well.â Upon saying this,Â she passed away. At that same moment, there were sounds and music, andÂ a thick rainÂ of divine flowers fell from the sky, allÂ accompanied by streams of rainbow lights. Due to the merit of building this great <em>stÅ«pa</em>, SamvarÄ« the poultry-woman attained buddhahood asÂ SamayadevÄ« PramohÄ.&quot;</p>
<p>âHer sons then discussed among themselves: âThough our old mother was born but a poor poultry-woman, she set us up as respectable householders and then, with the earnings left over, she built this great <em>stÅ«pa</em>, rare to find throughout the whole of JambudvÄ«pa, something marvelous and supreme!Â If she could do this, then we sons can nowÂ repay her kindness, ourÂ motherâs virtuous roots, by adding the dome to her <em>stÅ«pa</em>.â TheyÂ all agreed and, as before, the sons loaded up their elephant and donkey with bricks, aided by a single servant. Together they kept building for another three years, and, finally, after seven years in total, the construction was complete.&quot;</p>
<p>âWithin the <em>stÅ«pa</em>âs life-pillar, they placed a full MagadhanÂ measureÂ of theÂ Buddha KÄÅyapaâs relics, and then arranged gatherings of offerings beyond measure. When the time came to toss the flowers of consecration, not only did Buddha KÄÅyapa and his entourageÂ arrive in the sky before them, but so didÂ all the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions, surrounded by countless arhats, as well asÂ theÂ buddhas of the five families, the lords of the three families, andÂ innumerable peaceful and wrathful deities. It was completely inconceivable, like a sesame pod split open, overflowing!&quot; </p>
<p>âAs they threw flowers and uttered elaborate words of auspiciousness, divine music of all types resounded, a thick rain of divine flowers fell, and the sweet scent of divine incense filled every direction. The whole earth trembled three times, and then,Â from the awakened forms of the gathered TathÄgatas, countless light rays shone so that for three days it seemed there was no difference between day and night!â</p>
<p><em>This completes the first chapter ofÂ The History of the Great Jarung KashorÂ StÅ«pa, which illustrates how the stÅ«pa was built and consecrated. Samaya! Seal! Seal! Seal!</em></p>
<h4>Chapter 2: Prophecy and Aspirations</h4>
<p>Once more, King Trisong Deutsen made a request to the precious master saying, âO great master! Please tell us the history of how the aspirations made before this great <em>stÅ«pa</em>, the <em>stÅ«pa</em> none other than the immeasurably marvelous Jarung Khashor, were fulfilled.â </p>
<p>The MahÄguru replied, âListen then, great king! When the great <em>stÅ«pa</em> was consecrated with the scattering of flowers and marvelous miraculous signs, an immeasurable gathering of buddhas and bodhisattvas all spoke in perfect unison, saying, âO, fortunate sons of noble family! Listen up! It is with utterly pure intention that you have constructed a <em>stÅ«pa</em> such as this, a supreme representation of the <em>dharmakÄya</em>, no different from the wisdom mind of all the victors throughout the three times. The virtuous result of this will be the accomplishment of all your individual aspirations, just as you wish. Thus, make aspirations!â</p>
<p>âAt this, the sons discussed amongst themselves. âOur sweet old mother laid out and constructed the foundation for this <em>stÅ«pa</em> with such immense altruistic intentions. Yet she has now since passed away. Thus, by the virtue of having completed it, together with our motherâs roots of virtue, all the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions have directly revealed themselves to us her sons, saying, âWhatever aspiration you make will be fulfilled. Thus, make aspirations!â Having obtained such a boon, we should each make rather grand aspirations!â </p>
<p>âThe eldest son, the son of the horse-keeper, thought to make an aspiration as grand as possible. âPresently there is a frozen borderland of ice in the kingdom to the North. All of its mountains are buried in snow. Its valley floors are filled with water. In summer its waters are the home for many birds, but in the winter they turn into frozen plains. There is a prophecy that, once the waters have all dried up, this is the place that the bodhisattva AvalokiteÅvara will transform into a tamed land for the teachings of the TathÄgata ÅÄkyamuni. Thus, I must aspire to establish the Buddhaâs teachings in that very land where they will flourish.â </p>
<p>âWith that in mind, he made the following aspiration: âIt was with an utterly pure intention that we completed our motherâs <em>stÅ«pa</em>. By virtue of this, may I be born in the future times of the five rampant degenerations as a great king who nourishes the Dharma, the teachings of the TathÄgata ÅÄkyamuni, in that frozen borderland of ice. May I thereby establish the precious teachings of the Buddha!â </p>
<p>âAfter that, the son of the swineherd made his aspiration, âBy virtue of completing our motherâs <em>stÅ«pa</em>, you will be born as a king who protects the Dharma and establishes the Buddhaâs precious teachings, elder brother. When that happens, the foundation of the teachings, the community of saá¹gha, will need to be established in that frozen borderland of ice. May I therefore be born as a pure, fully ordained monk, a great preceptor who will ordain the entire <em>saá¹gha</em>!â</p>
<p>âAfter that, the son of the dog-keeper spoke his aspiration: âBy virtue of completing our motherâs <em>stÅ«pa</em>, one of you will establish the Buddhaâs teachings and one will uphold them in that frozen borderland of ice, my two elder brothers. When that happens, may I be born not from a womb but miraculously upon the anthers of a lotus flower. I shall cut the cycle of birth and death, and my lifespan will equal that of the sun and moon. Having been born as the one who can mightily tame gods, demons, and humans, may I subdue all malevolent spirits and demons within that very borderland and help fulfill the wishes of you both! May I be born as a powerful mantra master, to protect the entirety of the Buddhaâs teachings.â</p>
<p>âAfter that, the son of the poultry-keeper made his aspiration: âBy virtue of completing our motherâs <em>stÅ«pa</em>, one of you will establish the Buddhaâs teachings, one will uphold them, and one will protect them in that frozen borderland of ice, my three elder brothers. When that happens, it is not guaranteed that you will all be born in the same location. Therefore, may I be born as a royal minister, one who delivers the messages that will allow you all to reunite.â</p>
<p>âAt that time, all the buddhas and bodhisattvas spoke in perfect unison, saying, âO, fortunate sons of noble family, you have made grand aspirations â excellent, excellent! The buddhas all rejoice! Even if all the buddhas throughout the three times were to try to measure the extent of such a mass of merit as this, they couldnât possibly succeed.â The buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions then gathered together into a sphere of light and dissolved into the <em>stÅ«pa</em>. Thus, this <em>stÅ«pa</em> is also renowned as <em>The StÅ«pa of the Gathering of All Buddhas</em>. </p>
<p>âHowever, in that same moment, a mosquito<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> landed on the neck of the horse-keeperâs son and started sucking his blood. Bothered by this, he brushed it aside with his hand and immediately found the mosquitoâs dead body. Feeling immense compassion, he made the following aspiration: âWhen I am born as a Dharma protector king in the frozen borderland of ice, may this very insect be born as my heir, the prince, and may he practice the Dharma.â</p>
<p>âThe donkey thought that an aspiration prayer would then also be made for him, yet no such prayer was made. At that he became enraged and made the following aspiration: âWhen the eldest brother is born as a Dharma protector king in the frozen borderland of ice and establishes the teachings of the Buddha there, may I be born at that time as a prime minister who despises the Dharma, someone who can render all of his activities useless.â</p>
<p>âThe loyal servant heard these words and accordingly made the following aspiration: âWhen the donkey is born as that demonic minister and creates obstacles for the Dharma, may I be born as a minister of religion who can skillfully avert all of his crafty schemes and put an end to his power.â</p>
<p>âThe elephant also thought that an aspiration prayer would be made in his favour, yet no such prayer was made. At that he too became enraged and made the following aspiration: âIâve been carrying all these stones and dirt around, but they havenât made any prayer for me whatsoever. So be it! May I be born as a son or grandson of the king, and may I extinguish the teachings that they have established.â</p>
<p>âA passing raven heard these words and, with the intention to benefit others, made the following aspiration: âWhen he is born as a royal son or grandson and tries to extinguish the Buddhaâs teachings, may I be born as a great bodhisattva and kill that demonic prince.â</p>
<p>âIn that moment, two skinny Brahmin youths who were wearing the holy thread made the following aspiration: âWhen you all establish the precious teachings of the Buddha in the frozen borderland of ice, may we both be born as the <em>lotsÄwas</em> who will translate the entirety of the sublime Dharma.â</p>
<p>âAt the same time, two royal daughters with keen minds made the following aspiration: âWhen you all establish the precious teachings of the Buddha in the frozen borderland of ice, may we both be born superbly skilled in all the literary arts, as scribes for the sublime Dharma. May we then commit the entirety of the words of the Buddha into writing, along with all the commentaries.â </p>
<p>âAdditionally, other prayers were made at that time for the benefit of the teachings, unfathomable and beyond number. All the aspiration prayers described above, without exception, were fulfilled. Thus, the eldest brother, the son of the horse-keeper, who aspired at that time to be king â is you, Trisong Deutsen, the royal protector of the Dharma. </p>
<p>âThe son of the swineherd, who aspired to be the preceptor, is now the great abbot ÅÄntaraká¹£ita.<br/>
âThe son of the dog-keeper, who aspired to be the master of mantra, is now me, the scholar from Uá¸á¸iyÄna, Padmasambhava.<br/>
âThe son of the poultry-keeper, who aspired to be the minster, is Bami Trizher from Yarlung.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a><br/>

âThe elephant, who made the perverted aspiration to be born as the evil king and extinguish the teachings, will be an evil king by the name of Lang, born three generations after you, O king, and he will attempt to extinguish the Buddhaâs teachings.
âThe raven, who aspired to kill that evil king in order to benefit others, is now the prince Murub Tsenpo. In the future, when the evil king by the name of Lang appears and attempts to extinguish the Buddhaâs teachings, a bodhisattva by the name of Lhalung Palgyi DorjÃ©<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> will be born and will kill the evil king.

<p>King Trisong Deutsen and all those gathered there were mesmerized at the Great Guruâs words. Filled with faith, they prostrated themselves so many times it seemed their skulls would pop out of their heads. Tears streamed down their faces, and again and again they made heartfelt prayers for the benefit of the teachings and sentient beings. </p>
<p><em>This completes the second chapter of The Story of the Great Jarung Kashor StÅ«pa, which illustrates the prophecies of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, the aspirations that were made, and their fulfillment. Samaya. Seal! Seal! Seal!</em></p>
<h4>Chapter 3: Benefits of Circumambulation and Making Offerings</h4>
<p>The Dharma King Trisong Deutsen asked, âO great master! What are the benefits of prostrating, circumambulating, and making offerings to this great <em>stÅ«pa</em>, the very embodiment of all the buddhas of the three times?â </p>
<p>The Great Guru replied saying, âListen then, great king, and give rise to sincere faith! This <em>stÅ«pa</em> is the wisdom-mind-support of the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the three times; having merged inseparably, it is here that they remain. All supplications and aspirations made here will be effortlessly and spontaneously accomplished, just as with a precious wish-fulfilling jewel. For those with pure intent, the benefits of prostrating, circumambulating, and making offerings cannot be expressed even by all the buddhas of the three times; they are immeasurable. Yet, in order to encourage enthusiasm in sentient beings yet to come, I will briefly recount the benefits. </p>
<p>âThis great <em>stÅ«pa</em> is the supreme wisdom-support of all the buddhas of the three times, serving as the field of offering for the world with its beings and gods.

<p>The king and entourage were filled with wonder, amazed beyond measure. Immense faith arose within them and tears fell from their eyes. Their bodies hit the floor as they offered a thousand prostrations [before the Guru].</p>
<p>âEmaho! The benefits and qualities of such a <em>stÅ«pa</em> are so wondrous! Since not even the buddhas could express it, and since it is beyond the conceptual thought of us beings, how could we even begin to put it into words?! From now onward, in lifetime after lifetime, may we make vast offerings, gatherings beyond measure, to this great <em>stÅ«pa</em>!â</p>
<p><em>This completes the third chapter ofÂ The History of the Great Jarung KashorÂ StÅ«pa, which illustrates the benefits of circumambulating and making offerings. Samaya! Seal! Seal! Seal!</em></p>
<h4>Chapter 4: TheÂ signsÂ and the timeÂ for restoration</h4>
<p>Once again King Trisong Deusten asked, âO great master, please tell us whether or not the power of the corrupted age will cause this great <em>stÅ«pa</em>, which is like a wish-fulfilling jewel, to deteriorate and decay? If it doesÂ break down, decay, orÂ degenerate, what kinds of inauspicious signs will appear in this world? And if there are such ill omens, what will be the properÂ time and means for its restoration?â</p>
<p>In answer, the MahÄguru responded, âListen here, great king. Ultimately this great <em>stÅ«pa</em> is indivisible from the <em>dharmakÄya</em> of all theÂ buddhas, so no breakage, decay and degeneration will occur. But according to conventional appearances, some breakage and decay will appear due to the four elemental conditions. Some emanation of the Lords of the Three Families<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> will then repair it, or the Frowning One,<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> Noble Lady TÄrÄ.</p>
<p>âTo be more specific, when strife arrivesÂ andÂ lifespans are reduced to fifty years, the teachings of the Victorious One, ÅÄkyamuni, will degenerate. The monastic communities will be filled with laypeople, the temples will become fighting rings, and monastic institutions will be made into slaughterhouses.Â  </p>
<p>âMountain-dwelling yogis will descend to the valleys; great meditators will take upÂ farming; and realized yogis will watch overÂ the cattle. Fully ordained monks will adopt a householderâs life, with renunciant monks committing robbery and banditry of all differentÂ kinds. In communities, trouble will rise up like a whirlwind, as conflicts and contradictory views fan out from the centre [of the land]. </p>
<p>âNuns will kill their ownÂ bastard children.Â Family estates will be looted by others, and family homes will no longerÂ be in the hands of their heirs. Local leaders will act like barbarians. Young girls will roam about monkâs quarters. Heretics will call out âSo!â in silent places of retreat.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> </p>
<p>âThe wealth of monasteries will be seized, the scriptures of the Sugatas and sacred shrine offerings pawned off. The representations of enlightened body, speech and mind will be stolen and then sold on the market at a price. Temple basements will become barns for horses and cows, and their dung will pile up high.</p>
<p>âAt such a time, <em>gyalpo</em> spirits will possess the hearts of monks, <em>mÄras</em> will possess the hearts of <em>mantrikas</em>, <em>tsen</em> will possess the hearts of heretics, <em>gongpos</em> will possess the hearts of men, <em>theâurang</em> the hearts of children, and <em>senmo</em> the hearts of women. <em>Damsi</em> will possess the hearts of nuns, and <em>dremo</em> the hearts of girls.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a> In short, the heart ofÂ each and every Tibetan will be possessed by aÂ demon. </p>
<p>âAs signs of their possession, the people will cover their bodiesÂ withÂ clashing assortmentsÂ of clothes. Monks will prettify themselves,Â and nuns will gaze in the mirror. Everyone will arm themselves with weapons, and people will pour virulent poisons into each otherâs food. Evil-minded khenpos and lopÃ¶ns will teach.<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a> No longer will people be able to believe their district heads and governors. Men wonât be able to keep their discretion and honour. Women wonât be able to guard their bodies. Monks wonât be able to keep their discipline, and <em>mantrikas</em> won't be able to keep their <em>samayas</em>. </p>
<p>âNegative forcesâearth lords and the planet Rahula, <em>gyalpos</em>, <em>gongpos</em>, and <em>theâurangs</em>âwill become widespread, and peopleâs speech, jewellery and clothing will change, year after year. </p>
<p>âOrdinary folk will teach the Dharma, and old ladies will speak high words about the view. Charlatans will bestow fake empowerments, and liars will act like great meditators. Sly and silver-tongued folk will make themselves out to be learned, and proud folk with degenerate <em>samaya</em> will be held in high esteem. Common subjectsÂ will take over the throne, and the king will be reduced to a commoner. Leaders will be slaughtered, and the most respected will be those who have the most sin.Â  </p>
<p>âGurus who teach the profound Secret Manta will wander about like dogs, and perverted disciples with no <em>samaya</em> will roam like lions. These demonic manifestations will pay lip service to views practiced in error. With the gurus hidden, these imposters will display their own greatness as much as they can, disparaging those <em>siddhas</em> and learned ones who are acting in accord with the Buddhaâs word. Fakes and frauds, they will conduct themselves in secret, with all sorts of mockery.</p>
<p>âOrdinary people will wear cotton cloth and put on monksâ attire, while monks will don Mongolian dress. Even butchers whoâve committed murder will wear the saffron dharma robes! People will learn spells and black magic, and monks will brew poison by engaging in deception and profiteering. All kinds of mistaken dharma will be written and published, and the true Word of the Conqueror and the true transmission of the Vajra Master will start to become confused.Â  </p>
<p>âAll kinds of mistaken dharma, never seen before, will be practiced. All kinds of mistaken practices will spread, and actions previously unthinkable will occur. Unrecognisable new precedents will be established. All good traditions will be set aside, and all kinds of harm will be perpetrated. The property of the three precious jewels will be plundered, and their oaths quickly forsaken, becoming food for the greedy. </p>
<p>âThrough this, all beings will enter all manner of wrong paths. Through the force of committing every kind of negative deed, they will forget the virtuous dharma protectors, who will no longer protect them. Time,Â the stars and theÂ planets will deviate from their normalÂ course, and constellations and comets will appear that have never been seen before. Timely rains wonât come, while rain water in the valleys will rise.Â  </p>
<p>âMany bad years of famine, frost and hail will come, one after the other. The <em>mamo</em> and <em>tenma</em> spirits will be angered, and many unidentifiable diseases will spread like wildfire among humans and animals. Out of nowhere, the earth will shake, the waters will rise, fires will blaze, great winds whip up, and the monasteries, <em>stÅ«pas</em>, towns and the rest will all of a sudden be wiped out. At such a time, this great <em>stÅ«pa</em> will also break down andÂ fall into decay. </p>
<p>âDue to these flaws, the time will come whenÂ the Dharma Wheel will degenerate at India's Diamond Throne,<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> andÂ warfare will riseÂ up like the wind in the land of Nepal, with no letting upâ¦</p>
<p>âWhen for aÂ generation there is famine in the land of India,<br/>
âWhen forÂ aÂ generation there are all kinds of infectious diseasesÂ inÂ the heart of Nepal,<br/>

âWhenÂ the Rasa Trulnang<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a> is threatened by water,<br/>
âWhen Glorious SamyÃ© collapses and falls into decay,<br/>
âWhen the dharma wheel of the Tratruk StÅ«pa<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a> becomes crooked,<br/>
âAnd when the great holy sites of Tibet are left empty,<br/>
âWhen the heretics cry of âSo!â fills the places of retreat,<br/>
âWhen all the great monastics are dying from poisoning,<br/>
âWhen the teachings of explanation and practice are fragmented byÂ quarrels,<br/>
âWhen those beings who uphold the teachings suddenly pass away,<br/>
âWhen charlatans play tricks, with degenerate <em>samayas</em>,<br/>
âWhen wolves donning yellow robes<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a> sing long-songs,<br/>
âWhen Tibet and Kham are filled with demonic emanations,<br/>
âWhen the silken knot of the divine dharma<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a> is loosened,<br/>
âWhen the grass rope of the humane principles<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[25]</a> is cut,<br/>
âWhen the golden yoke of royal law is split,<br/>
âWhen the cheerful lake of local law dries up,<br/>
âWhen the modestÂ coat of personal law is shed,<br/>
âWhen dharma practitioners become lowly and powerless,<br/>
âWhen those bereft of dharma and without shame become powerful leaders,<br/>
âWhen abbots, teachers and <em>geshes</em> act and serve as governors,<br/>
âWhen ordinary folk preside over <em>gaá¹acakras</em>, teach Dharma and bestow empowerments,<br/>
âWhen thereâs hope for flattery and recompense when gathering merit,<br/>
âWhen the people are being led by demented butchers,<br/>
âWhen the mountains, valleys and roads are flooded with bandits,<br/>
âWhen those who are the hope of Tibet are beaten by whoeverâs able,<br/>
âWhen all is fragmented, devoid of <em>samaya</em>, law, or leader,<br/>
âAnd when, by their own conduct, Tibet and Kham are conquered â </p>
<p>âWhen allÂ these terrible times arrive in this world, it will be because of this great <em>stÅ«pa</em>âsÂ collapse and decay. Indeed, these are the signs that the time for its restoration has come. At that point, one who has good fortune and a karmic connection will cast aside all thoughts of this life, and, generatingÂ a vast and superior wish,Â they will undertake the restoration, and it will be accomplished.â</p>
<p>The King Trisong Deusten and all those assembled felt bewildered and terribly frightened. Feeling shaken, his heartÂ unsettled,Â one amongÂ them let out long, deep sigh and then rose from his seat: it was the minister of religious affairs from the GÃ¶ clan, Pema Gungtsen. He first offered one hundred full prostrations and then declared, âO great <em>ÄchÄrya</em>! May I be the one, at that evil, corrupt time, to restore the great <em>stÅ«pa</em>!â</p>
<p>âMay it soÂ be done!â the MahÄguru prayed, as this request was echoed by the abbot and <em>lotsÄwas</em>, while the Dharma King rejoiced and made his own aspirations to help. </p>
<p><em>This completes the fourth chapter from the History of the Great Jarung Kashor StÅ«pa,Â which illustrates theÂ signs and times when restoration will be necessaryÂ due to theÂ decayÂ that will occur during theÂ degenerate age,Â when lifespans have dwindled to fifty years. Samaya. Seal! Seal! Seal!</em></p>
<h4>Chapter 5: The Restorers and the Benefits of the Restoration</h4>
<p>Again, King Trisong Deutsen requested, âO great <em>ÄchÄrya</em>! In the degenerate age, when the life-span of beings has diminished to fifty years, when the great <em>stÅ«pa</em> needs to to be repaired as you foretold, where will my minister, the old Pema Gungtsen of the GÃ¶ clan be born? Which name will he have and what marks will he bear? How many virtuous helpers will emerge? And, what benefits will there be from their restoration of the great <em>stÅ«pa</em>?â</p>
<p>The MahÄguru replied, âO great king, listen well! Your questions are excellent! In the future, in the degenerate age, when the life-span of beings has diminished to fifty years, when one hundred and one bad omens appear, the minister of religious affairs of the GÃ¶ clan, Pema Gungtsen, will take birth, due to his former aspirations, in upper Nyima in Tsang.<a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[26]</a> He will be born into a family of Mantrikas in the bird or pig year. He will be named Pal or Zangpo,<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[27]</a> and he will be bright, courageous and strong. Due to genuine aspirations made long ago, his karmic potential will awaken, and so already from his youth he will have great faith and devotion in the precious Three Jewels and the temples and representations of enlightened body, speech and mind. He will set out upon the MahÄyÄna path with a mind filled with compassion towards all sentient beings, and especially towards those who are destitute and impaired. Being of the MahÄyÄna type, he will be brave, and he will have trust in the profound meaning. Having mastered wrathful enlightened activity, he will let loose the roar of the fierce and wrathful teachings. He will perfect the approach and accomplishment of his <em>yidam</em> deity, and thus the Dharma protectors and guardians will listen to his command as he binds them under oath. Above all, from his youth onwards he will have fierce, unwavering devotion in me, Uá¸á¸iyÄna. </p>
<p>âIf this individual remains untainted by broken <em>samayas</em> or familial defilements,<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[28]</a> then in his twenty-fifth year he will restore the great <em>stÅ«pa</em>. If the work is postponed, but begun in his thirty-third year, the restoration will still be completed. If the work is postponed beyond this, then war will break out between Tibet and China, rising up like the wind. The negativity of this calamity will triple the weight of the non-virtue that preceded it. Epidemics and famine will clear out the land and cut short the nightly ritual of sleep.<a href="#fn:29" id="fnref:29" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[29]</a> An army of barbarian Mongols as numerous as five measures of mustard seed will invade Tibet from the highlands. For several years, terror will resound as though the sky were breaking apart. From the southern lowlands, an army will invade, equal to nine measures of mustard seeds. Thus nothing but constant terror will resound, like a roaring dragon. The armies will come racing like flashes of lightning, defeating everything up to and including the land of Choga in Ngari.<a href="#fn:30" id="fnref:30" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[30]</a> Then an army from the highlands will come and overthrow everything as far as China. Two-third of Tibetans will be slain by these swords, and all the temples, <em>stÅ«pas</em>, statues and scriptures will crumble. All across Tibet there will be ruin and desolation. The remaining survivors will flee to Lhoka,<a href="#fn:31" id="fnref:31" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[31]</a> Bhutan and the hidden valleys. Those who stay behind, attached to land and possessions, will be slaughtered by barbarians from Mongolia â and thus the people and wildlife of Tibet will be completely obliterated.</p>
<p>âDesiring to be liberated from such suffering, this person who possesses my blessing will arouse <em>bodhicitta</em> for the benefit of beings. Disregarding his own body and life, he will make fierce efforts, on a vast scale, to exhort all beings of India, Nepal, Mon and Tibet to move towards virtue. All those of virtue in Tibet, united and focused on a single goal, will have to strive to support him [in the task of restoring the <em>stÅ«pa</em>]. However, since most Tibetans have been seized by the demon of wrong views, there will only be a few â as rare as stars in the day time âÂ with devotion and faith in him. Nevertheless, he will be attended by a host of 130,000 with virtuous karmic connection, by 1,006 connected through profound aspiration prayers, by 108 who have been matured by advice on the key points of samaya, by fortunate benefactors â 16 male and 7 female. He will also have with him 8 bodhisattva emanations, 8 virtuous spiritual friends, 25 faithful male disciples, 5 <em>á¸ÄkinÄ«</em> emanations, 7 beings who carry the blessings of the <em>á¸ÄkinÄ«s</em>, and 25 maidens of high and noble birth. Together, they will dispel hindrances and obstacles. In particular, they will meet an emanated heart-son of myself, Uá¸á¸iyÄna (Padma Lingpa), an abbot (Drigung Kunga Rinchen) and a Dharma king (Karpo Kundrak).<a href="#fn:32" id="fnref:32" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[32]</a> Through their blessings, then, the restoration of the great <em>stÅ«pa</em> will be accomplished on a vast scale.</p>
<p>âIf the restoration is accomplished, beings living in southern JambudvÄ«pa will enjoy abundant harvests and happiness for 25 years, and beings living in India, Nepal and Bhutan will enjoy abundant harvests and happiness for 33 years. In particular, in the snowy land of Tibet, invasions by barbarian Mongol armies will be averted for 60 years, and the Tibetans will enjoy abundant harvests and happiness for 40 years. All the dharma practitioners of Tibet â all that they wish for will be accomplished. All the places of Dharma, the temples and monasteries of India and Tibet, such as Bodhgaya in India and glorious SamyÃ© in Tibet â these will remain unharmed by the four elements. All the obstacles to study and practice of the Dharma will be pacified, and the Dharma will spread far and wide. The lives of noble holders of the Dharma will be firm and their activities will be vast. Whatever deity or mantra is practiced by the <em>mantrikas</em> of Tibet â they will easily and quickly accomplish them. Power, wealth, enjoyments and merit will flourish for the descendants of King Trisong Deutsen and all leaders who abide by the Dharma and the rule of law. All the <em>gongpo</em> spirits who lay waste to Tibet, and evil beings incited by demons â all these will be eliminated. </p>
<p>âIn essence, all sentient beings who make a connection with this restoration will obtain, within three rebirths, the perfect body of a god or human. And, finally, they will go on to attain buddhahood in the western buddhafield of SukhÄvatÄ«. All those with faith, devotion and respect, and who rejoice in this great restoration, will, within seven rebirths, join the ranks of the <em>vidyÄdharas</em> in the Palace of Lotus Light on the Glorious Mountain. Any being who hears, sees, remembers or touches this great restored <em>stÅ«pa</em> â their obscurations caused by negative actions accumulated through 60,000 great eons will be completely and utterly purified. All those who make a connection with this being who leads the great restoration will attain supreme or ordinary accomplishment, depending on their greater or lesser devotion and faith. Finally, they will certainly abide within the stages of the <em>vidyÄdharas</em> in the presence of myself, Uá¸á¸iyÄna. In essence, the benefits of making offerings and prayers to this great <em>stÅ«pa</em> should be understood from reading the chapter on the benefits, as described extensively above. The totality of such merit could not be uttered, even by all the buddhas of the ten directions and three times, even if they were to recite them constantly for 100,000 eons. Therefore, the qualities of this <em>dharmakÄya</em> [<em>stÅ«pa</em>] transcend the realm of the expressible.â</p>
<p>As soon as the MahÄguru had spoken these words, everyone there was filled with marvel and astonishment. For the granting of this blessing and for the prophecy of such vast accomplishment of the roots of virtue in the dark ages of the final era, the whole assembly gave thanks and praised the speech of the great Uá¸á¸iyÄna.</p>
<p><em>This completes the fifth chapter of The History of the Great Jarung Kashor StÅ«pa which identifies the restorers and illustrates the benefits of the restoration. Samaya! Seal! Seal! Seal!</em></p>
<p><em>Khandroma YeshÃ© Tsogyal recorded in writing what Uá¸á¸iyÄna had spoken. Together with the cycle of teachings on the practice of The Guruâs Utterly Secret Heart Practice, this teaching was then hidden as a terma treasure behind the statue of MahÄvairocana in the upper storey of the great temple at Glorious SamyÃ©, the Unchanging, the Spontaneously Accomplished. Aspiration prayers were made that it would be found in future by someone with the right karmic connection.</em></p>
<p><em>This completes the great Liberation Upon Hearing: The History of the Jarung Kashor StÅ«pa.</em></p>
<p><em>Samaya! Seal! Seal! Seal! Treasure Seal! Hidden Seal! Entrustment Seal! Commandment Seal! Thus the four seals are placed!</em></p>
<p><em>I, the treasure revealer LhatsÃ¼n (Lhawang Gyatso Drolo) NgÃ¶nmo, having discovered the terma treasure behind the statue of MahÄvairocana, copied down this history spoken by the precious Uá¸á¸iyÄna. In accordance with the prophecy instructing me to reconceal the terma in a treasure site, I left a yellow parchment behind and hid the copied text in the southwestern side of the lion throne of the red stÅ«pa at SamyÃ©, making this aspiration prayer: âMay it be discovered in the future by someone with the right karmic connection!â</em></p>
<p><em>Samaya! Seal! Seal! Seal!</em></p>
<p><em>I, Ngakchang ÅÄkya Zangpo, through the compassionate blessing of Uá¸á¸iyÄna, received a prophecy in my dreams. Thus I discovered the terma treasure in the year of the male water monkey, on the eighteenth day of the sheep month. May it benefit all sentient beings!</em></p>
