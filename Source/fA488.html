	<h2>The Words of the Awesome Ones</h2>
<h3>A General Overview of the Three Yogas</h3>
<h3>from the Heart-Essence of the Vast Expanse</h3>
<p><em>revealed by Jigme Lingpa</em></p>
<p>Homage to the primordial expanse of Samantabhadra! </p>
<p>The single all-encompassing sphere of awareness<br/>
Is the place wherein all phenomena are liberated.<br/>
Although inconceivable vehicles of sÅ«tra and mantra are taught,<br/>
In fact, there is only one vehicle. </p>
<p>Ignorant, conceptually inclined beings<br/>
Will dispute the words of the vehicles.<br/>
For as long as beings abound in conceptual thoughts<br/>
There will likewise be an inconceivable number of vehicles.<br/>
This is what I, Samantabhadra, have taught. </p>
<p>Yet here, if we categorize these vehicles based on beingsâ faculties,<br/>
There are the superior, middling, and inferior.<br/>
When all three are divided once again into three,<br/>
Nine vehicles are taught:<br/>
The vehicles leading from the origin,<br/>
The vehicles of knowledge through ascetic practices,<br/>
And the vehicles of powerful transformative methods. </p>
<p>Among them, the paths that swiftly liberate<br/>
Extremely fortunate individuals in one lifetime<br/>
Are the vehicles of powerful transformative methods:<br/>
For those with superior faculties there is the path of the Great Perfection;<br/>
For those with middling faculties, the supreme Anuyoga;<br/>
And for those with lesser faculties, the MahÄyoga. </p>
<p>The essence of the generation phase is gradualism.<br/>
It serves as the ground for the entire Secret Mantra.<br/>
The nature of the perfection phase is instantaneity.<br/>
It is like the path of all the Secret Mantra.<br/>
The Great Perfection is the Dharma beyond the mind.<br/>
It is said to be the fruition of all the Secret Mantra. </p>
<h3>The MahÄyoga</h3>
<p>Absolute, unborn reality radiates<br/>
With the miraculous manifestations of the three concentrations.<br/>
To purify grasping, the world and beings<br/>
Arise as the circle of the palace and the deities.<br/>
Concerning the deities born from awareness,<br/>
To reduce self-importance,<br/>
Apply the antidote of subduing thoughts:<br/>
Meditate on the play of the main deity and retinue<br/>
In their limitless forms with variations in faces and limbs<br/>
That are symbolic and illustrate the ultimate meaning.<br/>
When within the emanated maá¹á¸ala of the world and beings<br/>
Oneâs three doors [are blessed] through deity, mantra and samÄdhi,<br/>
Confidence in the practice is born.<br/>
Train as oneâs own children and the child of others.<br/>
From the empowerment of compassion, the empowerment of insight,<br/>
And the cakra of the wisdom mudrÄ: </p>
<p>Firstly, for the <em>approach phase</em>,<br/>
All that appears and exists, saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a,<br/>
Including the aggregates, elements, and sense sources<br/>
Are understood to be the utterly pure maá¹á¸ala of deities.<br/>
By training in purity,<br/>
The Thus-Gone Ones are actualized<br/>
As oneâs own children. </p>
<p>Secondly, the <em>close approach</em><br/>
Is to approach the wisdom deity itself.<br/>
Its blessing ripens your mind<br/>
And you train in completely awakening<br/>
Unsurpassable wisdom.<br/>
Like melting, beating and polishing gold,<br/>
Practice naturally and assiduously<br/>
And you will become<br/>
A child of the Thus-Gone Ones. </p>
<p>Thirdly, there is the <em>accomplishment phase</em>.<br/>
The wisdom gained from practicing generation and completion phases<br/>
Gives rise to boundless great compassion,<br/>
Through the force of which you uphold the great samaya<br/>
That is consistent with benefitting all beings.<br/>
This is to make the Thus-Gone Ones<br/>
Oneâs own children. </p>
<p>Fourthly, there is the <em>great accomplishment</em>.<br/>
Based on the two great accumulations<br/>
You and others engage in the maá¹á¸ala of group accomplishment.<br/>
Having actualized the qualities of abandonment and realization<br/>
The two aims are spontaneously accomplished.<br/>
This is to become the child<br/>
Of the Thus-Gone Ones. </p>
<p>In this way, through the miraculous display<br/>
Of the four branches of approach and accomplishment<br/>
You will gain confidence in meditative absorption,<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a><br/>
And with its power you will perfect, within the confines of your body,<br/>
All the qualities of the ten grounds and the five paths. </p>
<p>Then, there are the manifestations of the three objects,<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a><br/>
Killing the three enemies, defeating the four demons<br/>
And avoiding the three ravines. </p>
<p>Through the strength of merit and wisdom,<br/>
One gains confidence in generation and perfection,<br/>
Eliminates course thoughts,<br/>
And the forms of the wisdom deities<br/>
Initially manifest as <em>mental objects</em>. </p>
<p>Through the power of the deitiesâ actual appearance reaching their full extent<br/>
And the proper training of the mind<br/>
The deities manifest as <em>sensory objects</em>. </p>
<p>Finally, when the body and mind are perfectly trained<br/>
The deities of the indivisible two truths<br/>
Manifest in actuality as <em>tangible objects</em>. </p>
<p>When these three objects are mastered<br/>
The appearance of the impure body is conquered<br/>
And you reach the supreme levels<br/>
Of the matured, power-over-life, mahÄmudrÄ<br/>
And spontaneously accomplished vidyÄdhara. </p>
<p>When the circle of generation<br/>
Is sealed with the profound perfection phase<br/>
The outer enemy of grasping at âmineâ,<br/>
The inner enemy of clinging to a self<br/>
And the secret enemy of emotions and all dualistic grasping<br/>
Are destroyed by the pure deityâs aggregates.<br/>
The sign that you have slain the three enemies<br/>
Is that you no longer cling to the ordinary aggregates. </p>
<p>The four demons are defeated in the following way.<br/>
Within the vast expanse of great bliss,<br/>
From the causal Heruka, the union of means and insightâ<br/>
The play of the great bliss-emptiness,<br/>
Arise clouds of bodhicitta nectar,<br/>
Inconceivable wisdom,<br/>
In arrays that radiate and are reabsorbed.<br/>
Without any attachment or grasping, the five poisons are enacted,<br/>
Offerings made to the Noble Ones and the benefit of others fulfilled.<br/>
At that time, the <em>demon of emotions</em> is defeated. </p>
<p>By knowing that all attachment, anger and grasping thoughts<br/>
Are the radiance of non-dual, naturally arisen wisdom,<br/>
Then, within the dharmatÄ reality free from abandoning and attaining<br/>
And beyond the bias of refuting and establishing things,<br/>
The deceitful <em>demon of the son of the gods</em> is defeated. </p>
<p>By realizing that the five limbs of the vajra aggregates<br/>
Are the five perfect buddhas<br/>
And by taking the form of the pure deity,<br/>
The <em>demon of the ordinary aggregates</em> is defeated. </p>
<p>The final fruition of the two accumulations<br/>
Is buddhahood and confidence in the generation and perfection phases.<br/>
Therein not a single thought<br/>
Of birth or death exists,<br/>
And so the <em>demon of the Lord of Death</em> is defeated. </p>
<p>Through the view free from partiality<br/>
You escape the <em>ravine of doubt and uncertainty</em>.<br/>
Through the meditation free from brightness and dimness<br/>
You escape the <em>ravine of dullness and agitation</em>.<br/>
Through the samayas of unerring conduct<br/>
You escape the <em>ravine of the inferior vehicles</em>. </p>
<p>The bases of purification are the ordinary body, speech, and mind,<br/>
And the agents of purification are deity, mantra, and samÄdhi,<br/>
Through which the results of purification, the Sugataâs body, speech, and mind, are obtained.<br/>
Within the circle of the three vajras<br/>
One is fully ripened and obtains ultimate Buddhahood. </p>
<p>These tenets of the MahÄyoga,<br/>
I, the Awesome One, have thus explained. </p>
<p><em>Samaya</em>. </p>
<h3>The Great Scripture, Anuyoga</h3>
<p>From the ultimate, basic space of phenomena,<br/>
The perfectly pure expanse of SamantabhadrÄ«,<br/>
Arises awarenessâSamantabhadra. </p>
<p>Without relying on words, while resting in the view<br/>
Of the natural, spontaneous presence<br/>
Of basic space and wisdom indivisible,<br/>
Generate the maá¹á¸ala of the relative deity<br/>
Through the power of mindful awareness.<br/>
Through the profound, spontaneously present meditative concentration<br/>
The stains of the two obscurations are purified<br/>
And the resultant four kÄyas are actualized:<br/>
This is taught to be the Anuyoga of perfection. </p>
<p>This tradition defeats the four demons in the following way.<br/>
Knowing that the three poisons are primordially the three kÄyas,<br/>
One realizes that emotions are primordially buddhas.<br/>
Beyond refutation and affirmation, adopting and abandoning,<br/>
The <em>demon of emotions</em> is defeated. </p>
<p>By realizing that phenomena and individuals,<br/>
Imputed as knowable things, visible and designated,<br/>
Are selfless and of equal taste,<br/>
The dualistic grasping, the <em>demon of the son of the gods</em>, is defeated. </p>
<p>All the aggregates, elements, and sense sources<br/>
Are unborn and primordially perfect as the mudrÄ of the deity.<br/>
They are equal yet distinct, and spontaneously present.<br/>
Thus attachment and clinging, the <em>demon of the aggregates</em>, is defeated. </p>
<p>Within the unchanging expanse of the nature of reality,<br/>
The divisions of life, death, and intermediate state fall away.<br/>
Thus within basic space there is nothing to be removed, nothing that obscures,<br/>
And so the <em>demon of the Lord of Death</em> is defeated. </p>
<p><em>Samaya</em>. </p>
<h3>The Natural Great Perfection</h3>
<p>Know that the deity itself is the actual bodhicitta<br/>
And mind itself is the buddha;<br/>
This is not created but has always been so. </p>
<p>Anything whatsoever that arises<br/>
Is unceasing and unestablishedâits nature is clarity.<br/>
This natural radiance that is free from thoughts and expressions<br/>
Arises as the various mudrÄs of the major and minor marks.<br/>
Merely appearing, yet not establishedâit is empty. </p>
<p>The way in which this tradition defeats the four demons is as follows.<br/>
Sky-like awareness<br/>
Has never been tainted by the defects of the poisons.<br/>
Quicksilvery wisdom<br/>
Defeats the great <em>demon of emotions</em>. </p>
<p>The three planes of existence are primordially awakened,<br/>
Spontaneously present as the kÄyas and pure realms<br/>
And beyond effort and exertion, causes and conditions.<br/>
And so the <em>demon of the sons of the gods</em>, with his divine appearance, is defeated. </p>
<p>In the space of great insight beyond thoughts,<br/>
The reality wherein there is no reified appearance,<br/>
There are no dualistic thoughts of clinging, permanence, and nihilism,<br/>
And so the compounded <em>demon of the aggregates</em> is defeated. </p>
<p>Intangible awareness,<br/>
The wisdom of mindfulness and clarity,<br/>
Is the dharmakÄya, beyond birth and death.<br/>
And so the <em>demon of the Lord of Death</em> is defeated. </p>
<p>This is the great tenet of Ati. </p>
<p><em>Samaya</em>. </p>
<p>The three yogas just explained<br/>
Can be further subdivided<br/>
And explained in nine sections. </p>
<p>The maá¹á¸ala that is gradually generated<br/>
Is referred to as the MahÄ of MahÄ.<br/>
The maá¹á¸ala that is spontaneously present<br/>
Is referred to as the Anu of MahÄ.<br/>
The absolute and unborn dharmadhÄtu<br/>
Is known as the Ati of MahÄ. </p>
<p>The instantaneously perfected maá¹á¸ala<br/>
Is asserted to be the MahÄ of Anu.<br/>
While the relative is the maá¹á¸ala of the deity,<br/>
The absolute is the pure space of phenomena:<br/>
This is referred to as the Anu of Anu.<br/>
The indivisibility of the deity and natural awareness<br/>
Is referred to as the Atiyoga of Anu. </p>
<p>Knowing saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a to be primordially the maá¹á¸ala<br/>
Is referred to as the MahÄ of Ati.<br/>
Knowing mind to be spontaneously perfect as the deityâs form<br/>
Is referred to as the Anu of Ati.<br/>
The essenceless space of the nature of mind,<br/>
Free from any conceptual elaborations,<br/>
Is referred to as the Ati of Ati. </p>
<p>Here I have explained the generation and perfection phases<br/>
Of the ground, path, and fruition,<br/>
Three sets of three,<br/>
Making nine divisions in total. </p>
<p><em>An explanation of the samayas was also included here, but I put off deciphering it and did not write it down.</em></p>
<p><em>These crucial points are greatly secret and superior to all,<br/>
Of few words yet meaningful, the very essence of the tantra section.<br/>
This general overview of the three yogas<br/>
Was given to the vidyÄdhara<br/>
Bearing the marks of a warrior at the point between his eyebrows,<br/>
Who was blessed by MaÃ±juÅrÄ«-dharmamitra.<br/>
Then it passed to the great KarmendrÄá¹Ä«.<br/>
When she revealed the intent of the symbolic scripts<br/>
I, [Padmasambhava], gained mastery over the great secret treasury of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s,<br/>
In the depths of my mind.<br/>
May it perfectly enter [my disciples'] hearts<br/>
And their perception arise as words and texts.<br/>
It is the quintessence of the treasures.<br/>
There is no doubt<br/>
That my three fortunate heart sons will receive it.<br/>
I fully entrust it to them.<br/>
If it is taught to unsuitable vessels, its meaning will be distorted.<br/>
The protectress of Mantra will guard it.<br/>
May the benefit of beings increase and the Teachings flourish!</em> </p>
<p><em>Samaya! Let the signs be absorbed.</em> </p>
