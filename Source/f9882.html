	<h2>The Biography of the Great Orgyen that Naturally Liberates On Sight</h2>
<h3>From <em>The Profound Secret Heart Essence of the á¸aÌkiniÌ</em> <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></h3>
<p><em>revealed by Dudjom Lingpa</em> </p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Homage to the principal guru, PadmÄkara!<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a><br/>
I bow to DharmakÄya Samantabhadra, the primordial ground;<br/>
I bow to Gangchen Tso,<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> spontaneous magical display;<br/>
I bow to Lake-Born Vajra,<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> the dance of myriad forms of compassion;<br/>
I bow to the tamer of those difficult to tame! </p>
<p>Long ago, in the Spontaneously-Arisen Temple of SamyÃ©,<br/>
Raised through the miraculous power of humans, gods and demons,<br/>
In the shrine room in the middle storey of the assembly hall<br/>
The sovereign Emperor, Trisong Detsen<br/>
Invited the great Orgyen to beat the dharma drum,<br/>
And a host of translators, scholars, and the Tibetan king and subjects came. </p>
<p>Then, both foreign and domestic ministers advised,<br/>
âSince the Emperor and the great Master<br/>
Will give edicts for the welfare of Tibet,<br/>
If this were done in a place where all can see and hear,<br/>
Then everyone could listen,<br/>
And we assembled ministers would be pleased.â<br/>
And all the hosts of ministers agreed. </p>
<p>Offering an arm-length of white silk brocade,<br/>
The noble son of Nub, SÃ¶nam Drak,<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> said:<br/>
âKye Ho! Lord of the black-headed Tibetans, Dharma King â<br/>
If the Emperor and Orgyen, the protectors of beings,<br/>
Were to address the ministers and subjects here,<br/>
The assembly would be uncomfortable.<br/>
It would be better if we reconvened on Yobok ChangmÃ© Plain.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a><br/>
For if all could hear the royal edicts,<br/>
No one, whether high or low, would contradict them.â<br/>
To that request, the sovereign Dharma King replied,<br/>
âIt would be better, just as he has said.â </p>
<p>So, at daybreak on the tenth day in the first month of summer,<br/>
They constructed a throne at Yobok ChangmÃ©,<br/>
And invited the great Orgyen to be seated there. </p>
<p>Then, offering various precious substances, such as gold, silver and so forth,<br/>
Along with multicoloured silk brocades of all five colours,<br/>
Emperor Trisong Detsen approached the Guide, the great Orgyen, and requested,<br/>
âKye Ho! O Sovereign, universal splendour, Vajra-bearer!<br/>
For all of us Tibetans, Emperor and subjects,<br/>
Please relate a short account of your life and liberation,<br/>
In order to support our faith and produce devotion!â<br/>
And the Emperor and subjects made full prostrations. </p>
<p>The great Orgyen said,<br/>
âListen, you faithful Tibetans, Emperor and subjects!<br/>
There is not much to my life story.<br/>
In the dregs of time, at the end of this eon,<br/>
Even though I, the Lotus-born, have arrived,<br/>
It will be difficult to benefit beings, as will they lack sufficient merit. </p>
<p>âInept adepts and charlatan âtreasure-revealersâ<br/>
Will infest the land, acting like madmen.<br/>
Relentlessly deceiving the minds of the ignorant through fraud and ruse,<br/>
They will roam everywhere like dogs.<br/>
People like that resort to lovers and friends<br/>
And depend on trinkets and gold. </p>
<p>âMy emanations â genuine, authentic yogis<br/>
Who, having abandoned activities,<br/>
Strive to practice the heart-essence in random mountain retreats â<br/>
Will be subject to slander, hurled like paving stones.<br/>
Therefore, when this profound treasure comes to be revealed,<br/>
Rare will be the ones with faith in it. </p>
<p>âBy the power of our positive aspirations and karmic connections,<br/>
The minds of teacher and retinue are inseparable,<br/>
So there is no need for an explanation of my life story<br/>
In order to train disciples. </p>
<p>âI myself have not really come into the world,<br/>
As I am the unelaborate dharmakÄya, like the maá¹á¸ala of the sun.<br/>
Yet from the perspectives of my disciples<br/>
My life story appears in myriad ways<br/>
According to every limited viewpoint,<br/>
Like wavering moons in bodies of water. </p>
<p>âHowever, since the Emperor so commands, I will briefly recount it.<br/>
Listen well, faithful men and women<br/>
Led by the ruler of black-headed Tibetans!â </p>
<h4>Chapter 1</h4>
<p>âMy life story is inconceivable<br/>
Because the scope of activities undertaken<br/>
By every type and manner of student is inconceivable â<br/>
There is not a single fixed parameter.<br/>
The ground as pure space is the great bliss of the all-encompassing space of phenomena;<br/>
The ground as appearance is AnantavyÅ«ha,<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> the ultimate nature. </p>
<p>âOn the relative level, for the sake of sincere students,<br/>
The perfect Buddha AmitÄbha<br/>
Manifests from the western SukhÄvatÄ« pure land,<br/>
To train disciples through compassionate methods. </p>
<p>âOn the tenth day of the middle month of summer, in the snake year,<br/>
An emanated mass of light marked with a <em>hrÄ«á¸¥</em> syllable<br/>
Entered the womb of Queen Nordzin Tso,<br/>
The wife of the nÄga King MigÃ¶n Karpo.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> </p>
<p>âAfter five months, a nÄga child named Ãd Tro,<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a><br/>
Exceedingly handsome and charming,<br/>
Overwhelmed all of the nÄgas, nyens, and earth-lords with his melodious voice.<br/>
In accordance with the body, speech, and mind<br/>
Of those to be trained, he manifested an illusory dance through skilful means.<br/>
He taught the dharma, transmitted tantras, gave vows, and bestowed empowerments.â </p>
<p><em>This is the first chapter of the biography of Padma that naturally liberates on sight, on how he took birth in the realm of the nÄgas and benefitted beings.</em> </p>
<h4>Chapter 2</h4>
<p>âThen, I saw that the human realm was ready to be tamed.<br/>
I saw the protector of the dharma, King IndrabhÅ«ti<br/>
Endowed with the power of merit in the human realm<br/>
In the land of Uá¸á¸iyÄna, one of the thirty-two countries of the world. </p>
<p>âLike stars amassed in the sky<br/>
Foreign and domestic ministers and hosts of soldiers<br/>
Surrounded the master and commander, the great King. </p>
<p>âThe King, the dharma protector, was wealthy but blind. He lamented:<br/>
âI have one hundred queens, yet not a single son â<br/>
And this despite all that has been done by dharma practitioners,<br/>
Mediums, astrologers, and dream-workers. </p>
<p>ââLikewise, I myself have done whatever rituals and virtuous deeds could be done.<br/>
When I asked all of them,<br/>
âIs there not some method for producing a son to rule the kingdom?â<br/>
They all said, âIf you distribute alms impartially, a son will be born.â </p>
<p>âThen, the blind wealthy King<br/>
Assembled the hosts of ministers, foreign and domestic, and royal consorts<br/>
Within a pleasure grove and settled on a high throne. </p>
<p>âAt the head of the rows and ranks of ministers and queens,<br/>
A great minister named Natha Vajra<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> asked,<br/>
âThe edict of the Dharma King himself has been issued,<br/>
But why are we ministers and subjects gathered?<br/>
We will excellently accomplish whatsoever we are commanded.â </p>
<p>âThe King said,<br/>
âThough I have no particular commands for you ministers and subjects,<br/>
Throughout day and night, I am constantly aware<br/>
That in this life, I am without the child I so need.<br/>
I do not have the teachings that will be necessary in later lives,<br/>
And I do not have the eyes that I need. </p>
<p>ââHalf of my life is over!<br/>
When I die, this dominion will have no lord, like an empty cavern.<br/>
This wealth will have no owner, like an illusory manifestation.<br/>
Conduct will be capricious, like childish play.<br/>
The subjects will have no ruler, like tea-leaves without tips.<br/>
The land will have no ruler, like a city of gandharvas.<br/>
When the land is held by this dead manâs widow, the realm will decline. </p>
<p>ââWhen I wander alone to the far shore,<br/>
My suffering will be a private burden.<br/>
Consorts, lords, subjects, property, wealth, enjoyments â none can be preserved.<br/>
Early in life, men hang around with friends,<br/>
Later, men chase after them like a house full of sparrows.<br/>
Thinking of this again and again, desolation fills my mind. </p>
<p>ââNow, I must try to find<br/>
A method for producing<br/>
A worthy son to hold the kingdom.<br/>
When I ask scholars for divination, calculation, and clairvoyance,<br/>
They say, âIf you distribute alms impartially, a son will be born.â<br/>
So now, in all directions,<br/>
We must give alms to the destitute â<br/>
Gather and spread the news to all those in need.â </p>
<p>âAll of the ministers and subjects assented,<br/>
And in all directions it was proclaimed:<br/>
âGather the hosts of the poor, the destitute, and the beggars!â </p>
<p>âAfter many years of generous giving to whoever was lacking,<br/>
The royal treasury eventually emptied.<br/>
The source of the generosity was exhausted, but the begging persisted.<br/>
Then, the King thought to himself,<br/>
âThe causes of generosity are no longer present,<br/>
So I must venture to the island in the ocean to get some jewels.â </p>
<p>âThen I, as the emanation of AmitÄbha,<br/>
Imparted this thought to the NÄga Lady Changchub Drolma:<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a><br/>
âWhen the truth is invoked, give what they request.â </p>
<p>âThe principal attendant responsible for clearing obstacles on the road<br/>
Assembled five hundred Buddhist and non-Buddhist masters.<br/>
Many attendants were commanded to give protection and avert obstacles.<br/>
The merchant Karma Zangpo<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a><br/>
Was instructed to prepare all requisite provisions<br/>
And five royal ministers embarked on a boat<br/>
Bound, with the merchant, to retrieve jewels from the ocean. </p>
<p>âOn the tenth day of the first month of summer in the monkey year,<br/>
In the middle of the limpid milky ocean,<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a><br/>
They saw a white child adorned with the major and minor marks,<br/>
Handsome and exalted,<br/>
Sitting on an opened lotus with one hundred multi-coloured petals<br/>
Within an expansive pavilion of five-coloured rainbow light. </p>
<p>âUpon seeing me, the merchant and royal ministers<br/>
Relayed what they had seen to the King.<br/>
Immediately after hearing of this,<br/>
His eyes were opened, as though waking from a dream. </p>
<p>âJoining his palms with delight, he respectfully asked,<br/>
âHow wondrous! A supreme embodiment of the Buddhas of the three times!<br/>
What is your homeland and lineage?<br/>
Who are your father and mother?<br/>
What is the purpose of your arising here?<br/>
To which domain do you want to go now?<br/>
I ask you to kindly tell me!â </p>
<p>âThen I replied,<br/>
âKye! Listen, O Sovereign Dharma King!<br/>
My father is Samantabhadra,<br/>
My mother is Great Bliss, SamantabhadrÄ«.<br/>
My homeland is the pure all-encompasing space of phenomena,<br/>
My lineage is the all-pervasive vajra-nature.<br/>
My bloodline is great unchanging enlightenment,<br/>
And I have come to this world to increase<br/>
Welfare and happiness in matters of religion and state.â </p>
<p>âAfter I gave that response, the King replied,<br/>
âPrecious child, emanation of the Buddhas,<br/>
I request that you come to my kingdom.â </p>
<p>âIn response to the invitation I said,<br/>
âWell then, one yojana<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> away from here, on the far shore,<br/>
Lies the jewelled castle of the land of the nÄgas,<br/>
Beautiful, alluring, and elegant. </p>
<p>ââIf you say to the nÄga princess Changchub Drolma,<br/>
âPlease, give me the jewel that I seek!â<br/>
She will give it, and we will retrace the path which brought you here.<br/>
Accordingly, the merchant, King, and ministers departed. </p>
<p>âUpon delivering the message to the nÄga Changchub Drolma,<br/>
She gave the wish-fulfilling jewel, the provider of desirables.<br/>
When they returned,<br/>
The King, an emanation of the Buddha,<br/>
Said that he had been to the palace.<br/>
Seated upon a lotus,<br/>
I was then known by the name Guru TsokyÃ© Dorje. </p>
<p>âWelcomed back with much incense and music,<br/>
The King invoked from the gem a jewelled throne â<br/>
And a lofty throne appeared, becoming and elegant. </p>
<p>âIn the year of the thirteenth zodiac house, I was enthroned as royalty.<br/>
I lived in the house of PrabhÄvatÄ«, the daughter of Dhaha.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a><br/>
I was then known as Guru Pema Gyalpo,<br/>
And for five years I remained in the kingdom.â </p>
<p><em>This is the second chapter of the biography of Padma that naturally liberates on sight, on how he held the kingdom of Uá¸á¸iyÄna.</em> </p>
<h4>Chapter 3</h4>
<p>âOne day, at the eastern gate of the palace, I was entertained<br/>
By dÌ£aÌkas and dÌ£aÌkiniÌs of the field of timeless awareness.<br/>
Conjuring up a great magical city,<br/>
They displayed the many permutations of the sufferings of beings<br/>
Such that I became weary of domestic life. </p>
<p>âLater, a spectacle occurred at the southern gate:<br/>
I saw many manifestations of sick and ailing people.<br/>
By seeing the fleeting nature of joy and happiness<br/>
I realized the vital point of impermanence, and that the body lacks an inherent nature. </p>
<p>âThat same day, I went to the western gate,<br/>
Where I saw signs of old age and poverty.<br/>
I saw that the activities of saá¹sÄra have no essence,<br/>
And since even the youthful and powerful end up this way,<br/>
I was sure that such suffering would fall upon us all. </p>
<p>âWhen I went to the scene at the northern gate,<br/>
I saw many expressions of dead and dying people.<br/>
In life there is no certainty; death is the sole authority.<br/>
I understood the signs<br/>
Of the need to cut my holding<br/>
To temporary, dream-like appearances as permanent. </p>
<p>âThen, when I disobeyed the Kingâs laws<br/>
And killed a ministerâs son<br/>
The King and subjects were cast into distress<br/>
And could not agree on whether I should be sent into exile. </p>
<p>âWhen the King and the hosts of ministers all assembled,<br/>
The minister named Zangden<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a> said,<br/>
âThe king, ministers, and subjects unanimously agree<br/>
That you have repeatedly broken the royal laws.<br/>
Because you act against the law and misbehave like this,<br/>
You are unfit to rule and must be exiled! </p>
<p>ââEven though Uá¸á¸iyÄna would soon be without a king,<br/>
Some suggest you be killed, others that you be jailed.<br/>
Still others say you must be banished to terrifying lands.<br/>
Finally, those who agree with me<br/>
Ask where you will be sent to live in exile.â </p>
<p>âIn response, I said,<br/>
âListen, O King, ministers, and upholders of the law!<br/>
Where will I go? To the purelands!<br/>
Though banished to terrifying places, I have no fear.<br/>
The vajrakaÌya knows neither birth nor death;<br/>
I am not afraid of you killing me.<br/>
You may place this apparent body â an illusion of unobstructed awareness â<br/>
In a miserable prison, but I will not be subdued. </p>
<p>ââWhether in the lower realms, on the earth, or in the kingâs domain,<br/>
All activities are the seeds of suffering.<br/>
If I canât stay here, I will go somewhere else â<br/>
To the most terrifying odious RohakÄla.<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a><br/>
King and ministers, stay in good health!â </p>
<p>âThen I made preparations to leave, but at my time of departure,<br/>
PrabhÄvatÄ« said, âI must follow you!â<br/>
So I then explained to her the unity of view, meditation, and conduct<br/>
For one month, and she fully understood it. </p>
<p>ââPrabhÄvatÄ«, you must now remain in the Kingâs domain.<br/>
I am a supreme illusory form of timeless awareness;<br/>
I never fear birth or death.<br/>
In life, much fear and suffering will come<br/>
To this heap of flesh and blood, the basis for the Truth of Suffering. </p>
<p>âTherefore, why follow in my footsteps?<br/>
Donât despair â we will later meet again.<br/>
There is no measure of life besides death, and no stability.<br/>
Strive diligently in virtue with your three doors, Noble One!â<br/>
With that and other such remarks, I imparted much advice and prophecy.â </p>
<p><em>This is the third chapter of the biography of Padma that naturally liberates on sight, on the skilful way he left the kingdom.</em> </p>
<h4>Chapter 4</h4>
<p>âThen I made my way to RohakÄla charnel ground.<br/>
The great universal splendour, Chemchok Heruka appeared,<br/>
Gave initiation, and taught uncontrived conduct to me,<br/>
As I stayed in the grove amongst the graves. </p>
<p>âAll of the people of the region gossiped,<br/>
âHe eats corpses, drinks blood,<br/>
And wears skins as clothing!<br/>
He kills the men he sees, and he joins with the women!â </p>
<p>âHearing of this, King ÅakrarÄja<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a><br/>
Gathered his ministers and subjects, and prepared to invade.<br/>
The King of Uá¸á¸iyÄna cried, âI have fostered the little son of demons!<br/>
He has been exiled to this region, so I must seize the charnel ground.<br/>
The denizens of this disastrous kingdom must be quickly put to death.â </p>
<p>âThen the legions of soldiers<br/>
Took up their arms.<br/>
They approached from the borders, surrounding the area.<br/>
Seeking to imprison me by force, they chanted, âKill! Kill! Strike! Strike!â </p>
<p>âThen, I mounted a black vulture.<br/>
Proclaiming, âHa! Ha!â<br/>
I soared through the sky to the east,<br/>
While the soldiers called me âShoraya the Demon.â<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a> </p>
<p>âI said, âI am the demon Shora ZhÃ¶nnu,<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a><br/>
You must leap into the realm of the sky!â<br/>
People said, âNow this country has gone bad.<br/>
Filled with arrogant gods and demons, it cannot be subdued by anything at all.<br/>
If one came here again, what could be done?â<br/>
Then they left and returned to their own country. </p>
<p>âLater on, I went to ÅÄ«tavana charnel ground.<br/>
There I beheld the deities of MahÄmÄyÄ,<br/>
And I received empowerment and instructions for attaining the treasury of the expanse.<br/>
Through the conduct of joining and liberation,<br/>
I subdued the mÄtá¹s and dÌ£aÌkinÌ£iÌs, binding them to my service. </p>
<p>âLater I sat on seats of human corpses.<br/>
After I transformed the corpses into nectar,<br/>
I obtained all supreme and ordinary siddhis without exception,<br/>
And I was known then as Guru ÅÄntaraká¹£ita. </p>
<p>âAfter three years, three months, and three days,<br/>
I went before the great master Prabhahasti<br/>
And requested to be trained in the dharma of yogic practice.<br/>
I beheld the assemblies of yogic deities,<br/>
Received empowerments, prophecies, blessings and siddhis,<br/>
And was praised as incomparable by the entire triple world.<br/>
My name was known as Guru Loden ChoksÃ©. </p>
<p>âThen, in accordance with that masterâs prophecy,<br/>
On the tenth day of the snake month<br/>
At the great cave of Äsura,<br/>
When I came into the presence of Änanda,<br/>
The monks saw excellent signs in their dreams â<br/>
The form of the Lord of Sages directly appeared. </p>
<p>âThe Venerable Änanda asked me candidly,<br/>
â<em>Ema</em>! Are you a human child,<br/>
A child of the gods, or a nonhuman miracle?<br/>
What is the purpose of your coming here?â </p>
<p>âIn response, I said,<br/>
âListen, great holder of the Sageâs teaching!<br/>
I am neither a child of humans nor of gods.<br/>
By the power of the Great Teacherâs previous aspirations,<br/>
I come as the heir of the Victors of the three times. </p>
<p>ââI was not born from a womb, but from a lotus in an ocean.<br/>
From the sÅ«tra perspective, I am the âVictorious ÅÄkya SengÃ©.<br/>
From the mantra perspective, I am Guru Pema JungnÃ© â<br/>
That is how I am praised in the Victorious Onesâ speech.â </p>
<p>ââIn order to engender genuine trust as a lineage holder,<br/>
I must follow a teacher and hear the advice of sÅ«tra and mantra.<br/>
In all the charnel grounds, I strive in the essential practice.<br/>
Now that my own benefit is accomplished, I work impartially for the benefit of beings.<br/>
Therefore, I wish to take ordination in the Buddhaâs teachings.<br/>
Please grant me permission, in accordance with the tradition.â </p>
<p>âThen, Änanda and the others rejoiced.<br/>
After their permission had been granted, at the time of my request,<br/>
The great god BrahmÄ draped a red woollen blanket over me,<br/>
The Earth Goddess bestowed a saffron robe,<br/>
And MahaÌdeva offered a flawless burgundy skirt.<br/>
Amazed, all of the monks praised these gifts. </p>
<p>âAfter taking ordination in the Buddhaâs teaching,<br/>
I was enthroned as the supreme lord of the doctrine,<br/>
And I was supplicated as the teacher, ÅÄkya SengÃ©. </p>
<p>âThen, on the tenth day of the monkey month,<br/>
I went to the great charnel ground of Dechen Dalwa<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a><br/>
Where I was assisted by the yaká¹£a Shenpa Marnak.<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[22]</a><br/>
I requested the great master ÅÄntiá¹garbha<br/>
To bestow the complete empowerments and transmission of wrathful mantra.<br/>
Once I had accomplished the maá¹á¸ala of wrathful mantra,<br/>
My name was known as Wangchuk Tsal.<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[23]</a> </p>
<p>âOn the tenth day of the tiger month,<br/>
I went to the Sangchen RolpÃ© Tsal charnel ground,<br/>

And requested the empowerment and transmission of mÄtá¹s and dÌ£aÌkinÌ£iÌs.<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[24]</a><br/>
When I had opened the maá¹á¸ala for seven days,<br/>
The foremost á¸aÌkinÌ£iÌ Siá¹hamukhÄ«<br/>
Actually appeared and bestowed prophecy, empowerment, and blessings. </p>
<p>âGiving me a triangular black stone, she said,<br/>
âYou will propagate fifty versions of my sÄdhana,<br/>
The innermost essence mantra Black Stone â the fourteen syllables â<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[25]</a><br/>
And myriad extremely profound points for protecting and averting.<br/>

You will conceal them as treasures and seal them with aspirations.â </p>
<p>âBy dissolving into my heart,<br/>
She merged with the treasury of the expanse of the great secret display of awareness.<br/>
My name, then, was Guru Pema DÃ¼ddul. </p>
<p>âLater, on the tenth day of the sheep month,<br/>
I went to the Rotang DalwÃ© Tsal charnel ground.<a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[26]</a><br/>
I requested the full empowerment and transmission of ÅrÄ« Heruka, enlightened mind.<br/>
From the great master VajramÄrajita.<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[27]</a><br/>
We opened the maá¹á¸ala and practiced for three months.<br/>
Directly perceiving the complete maá¹á¸ala,<br/>
I attained the sealed empowerment, blessings, and siddhis.<br/>
I was supplicated then as Guru DorjÃ© Drakpo Tsal. </p>
<p>âOn the tenth day of the rooster month,<br/>
In the grove of the Jikngam Hala charnel ground,<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[28]</a><br/>

While opening the maá¹á¸ala and practicing for ten months,<br/>
I beheld the array of deities in actuality,<br/>

For the extensive maá¹á¸ala of Padma, enlightened speech.<br/>
I opened the maá¹á¸ala and practiced for six months.<br/>
Beholding the maá¹á¸ala of Padma, enlightened speech,<br/>

<p>âArriving at the Fearsome ParuÅakÄvana,<a href="#fn:31" id="fnref:31" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[31]</a><br/>
I met the master NgonchÃ¶d DrubpÃ© Wangpo,<a href="#fn:32" id="fnref:32" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[32]</a><br/>
And obtained the complete empowerment,<br/>

When I was performing a sacred amá¹ta medicine-making ceremony,<a href="#fn:33" id="fnref:33" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[33]</a><br/>

<p>âFor twelve months I opened the maá¹á¸ala<br/>
Of the Palchen KadÃ¼.<a href="#fn:35" id="fnref:35" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[35]</a><br/>
I beheld the Nine Glorious Ones, and received empowerment and blessings.<br/>
Then Chipel<a href="#fn:36" id="fnref:36" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[36]</a> actually appeared to me<br/>
And I conquered the mundane arrogant guardians of the teachings.<br/>
Later, I overwhelmed all sentient beings without exception<br/>
And bound them to my service.<br/>
My name then was Guru Wangdrak Tsal.<a href="#fn:37" id="fnref:37" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[37]</a> </p>
<p>âThen I went to Malaya.<br/>

<p>âI practiced for one year<br/>

My name then was Guru Vajra TÃ¶treng. </p>
<p>âThen, I saw that Emperor AÅoka would make a fit disciple.<br/>
After flagrantly breaking the law,<br/>
The Emperor wanted me burned alive, but I transformed the inferno into a lake.<br/>
The Emperor marvelled and relented,<br/>
And the empire of AÅoka converted to the Dharma.<br/>
My name was then Guru TokmÃ© Dorje.<a href="#fn:41" id="fnref:41" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[41]</a> </p>
<p>âI went to VajrÄsana in India,<a href="#fn:42" id="fnref:42" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[42]</a><br/>
Where I debated the inner and outer doctrines for nine months<br/>
With the preeminent Extremist, SÅ«ryasiá¹ha,<a href="#fn:43" id="fnref:43" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[43]</a><br/>
And the sixty-four other Extremist teachers. </p>
<p>âThe Extremists were defeated through miracles,<br/>
But, as the noble NÄgeÅvara<a href="#fn:44" id="fnref:44" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[44]</a> commanded,<br/>

The six groups of Extremist teachers were liberated,<br/>

<p>âThen, arriving in the capital of King NÄgaviá¹£á¹uâs realm,<a href="#fn:46" id="fnref:46" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[46]</a><br/>
I consorted with the Queen.<br/>
The King grew irate, and gathered his lords and subjects.<br/>
He raised a pyre of sandalwood high and wide,<br/>
Liberally dousing it with sesame oil,<br/>
And placed me inside. </p>
<p>âThe fire blazed for seven days,<br/>
Yet, when he came to inspect, the inferno had become a lake.<br/>
There he saw me, seated on a lotus in the middle of it.<br/>
Full of remorse, the King, ministers, and subjects repented,<br/>
And offered the kingdom to me, converting the realm to the Dharma. </p>
<p>âDefeating all the Extremist teachers<br/>
By engaging in debate and using an array of miraculous powers,<br/>
I prevailed over all their challenges,<br/>
And the Extremists retreated into the forest. </p>
<p>âWhile striving in the activities of sorcery and lower mantras,<br/>
I said to the Great All-Pervasive Rahu,<a href="#fn:47" id="fnref:47" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[47]</a><br/>
âI command you to liberate the Extremists with lightning!â </p>
<p>âAt that time, I proclaimed,<br/>
âIn this world, I am unrivalled.<br/>

And then my name was Guru SengÃ© Dradok. </p>
<p>âThen I came to Dechen Dal charnel ground,<br/>
Where for three years I subsisted on elemental essences.<br/>
I gathered all of the dÌ£aÌkas and dÌ£aÌkinÌ£iÌs residing in the charnel ground<br/>
And gave empowerments and blessings, and bound them to my service.<br/>
I also bound the arrogant gods and demons to oaths.<br/>
I had a vision of TrÃ¶ma Nakmo,<a href="#fn:48" id="fnref:48" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[48]</a> and received siddhis.<br/>
My name was then Guru Nyima Ãzer. </p>
<p>âThen, to subdue the kingdom of Zahor,<br/>
With the direct emanation of the foremost mother dÌ£aÌkinÌ£iÌ GuhyajÃ±ÄnÄ,<br/>
The supreme consort of the Protector AmitÄyus â<br/>
The Princess MandÄravÄ â the daughter of the King of Zahor,<br/>
And the spritual consort for attaining the vidyÄdhara of with mastery over life,
I saw fit to overpower the kingdom of Zahor. </p>
<p>âThen, on the tenth day of the horse month,<br/>
Through the power of a magical emanation,<br/>
I arrived at the house of MandÄravÄ to see a radiant glow.<br/>
At that moment, the Princess and her ravishing retinue of servants<br/>
Joined their palms in amazement with faith, devotion,<br/>
And utmost respect, and requested teachings. </p>
<p>âBut the King overheard, and, incandescent with rage,<br/>
He sent a message for each and every person in the kingdom<br/>
To gather a measure of sandalwood and a measure of sesame oil. </p>
<p>âAt a place one yojana beyond the city limits<br/>
He burnt us alive. Then, after seven days had passed,<br/>
As everyone came to witness the spectacle,<br/>
They saw that we were completely unharmed.<br/>
The pyre had been transformed to a lake, and we sat on a lotus in the middle. </p>
<p>âBeings of the eight classes â gods, nÄgas, and so forth â<br/>
Were in attendance, paying homage and listening to teachings.<br/>
The King and ministers were accordingly repentant,<br/>
And invited me to the highest storey of the palace,<br/>
Where they offered the Princess and the kingdom to me.<br/>
I stayed in Zahor for three hundred human years,<br/>
Converting the royal domain to the noble Dharma.<br/>
Then my name was Guru Padmasambhava. </p>
<p>âWhen the nations in the four directions contested my claim to the princess<br/>
The eight classes of gods and demons made me their emissary of activity<br/>
To forcefully repel the armies of the four directions.<br/>
Then I cultivated the practice of the vidyÄdhara of with mastery over life. </p>
<p>âOn the tenth day of the sheep month<br/>
I set out in a chariot accompanied by the Princess.<br/>
Bypassing the Kingsâ amassed legions,<br/>
We arrived at the MÄratika Cave,<br/>
And all the ministers and subjects returned to their homes. </p>
<p>âFor three months we practiced<br/>
The longevity ritual of the Protector AmitÄyus.<br/>
Protector AmitÄyus appeared in the space before us,<br/>
And we obtained empowerment, blessing, and prophecy.<br/>
When the united consorts dissolved into masses of light,<br/>
We attained longevity beyond birth and death. </p>
<p>âLater, I saw the realm of Uá¸á¸iyÄna as ready to be tamed.<br/>
On the tenth day of the first month of summer<br/>
We arrived in Uá¸á¸iyÄna, and when all the lords and subjects<br/>
Burned me alive, the mass of fire was transformed into a lake. </p>
<p>All the lords and subjects were boundlessly remorseful.<br/>
To control the kingdom, I stayed in the capital,<br/>
And, taming them, I established the kingdom in the Dharma. </p>
<p>âThen, the supreme child ManunÄtha<br/>
Was born to the Queen PrabhÄvatÄ«.<br/>
Bestowing blessings and empowerments in the kingdom,<br/>
I made aspirations for the kingdom to be ruled in accordance with the Dharma. </p>
<p>âLater, I returned once again to Zahor.<br/>
I taught the doctrine of secret mantra to VihÄradhÄra.<br/>
In particular, I taught him the <em>Vajra Garland longevity practice</em>.<a href="#fn:49" id="fnref:49" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[49]</a><br/>
Accomplishing the practice, he attained the state of the vidyÄdhara of with mastery over life. </p>
<p>âThen I thought that the kingdom of Gesar<a href="#fn:50" id="fnref:50" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[50]</a> was ready to be tamed.<br/>
Princess MandÄravÄ transformed into a dragon,<br/>
I mounted her in the form of YÄmarÄja,<br/>
And we approached King WangdÃ¼ Zibar.<a href="#fn:51" id="fnref:51" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[51]</a> </p>
<p>ââO King!â I proclaimed to him,<br/>
âYour life is almost over,<br/>
I am YamÄrÄja.<br/>
There is no time, we must go swiftly!â </p>
<p>âIn a panic, the King replied,<br/>
âAlas! Longevity Lord of mortal beings,<br/>
If there is a way for me to avert death<br/>
I would offer my kingdom, with its subjects and treasury, to you,<br/>
And I will be your disciple.<br/>
Whatever you command, I will do!â </p>
<p>âIn response to his vow, I issued my command:<br/>
âAssemble all of your ministers!â<br/>
The King beat a large drum three times,<br/>
And immediately, the host of ministers gathered. </p>
<p>âBecause of my overwhelming resplendence,<br/>
They all asked, âWhat is this?â<br/>
To which the King replied,<br/>
âIf all of you ministers<br/>
Wish to prolong your Kingâs lifespan,<br/>
We must offer the entire kingdom without reservation.â </p>
<p>âIn saying that, he installed me on the royal throne<br/>
And I held the kingdom for seventy human years,<br/>
Converting the entire land to the virtuous Dharma. </p>
<p>âThen, I thought that the King of Persia<a href="#fn:52" id="fnref:52" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[52]</a> would be a worthy disciple.<br/>
So, when the tenth day of the monkey month arrived,<br/>
I emanated as the child of Queen HÄritÄ«,<br/>
The Queen of King Mijik Rabten.<a href="#fn:53" id="fnref:53" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[53]</a> </p>
<p>âI said, âKye Ho! Listen closely, great King!<br/>
There is no heir for your kingdom other than me!<br/>
I am Prince ZilnÃ¶n Pawo<a href="#fn:54" id="fnref:54" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[54]</a> â<br/>
You must seek my permission in all matters of religion and politics.â </p>
<p>ââThe Great King, thought,<br/>
My son is merely three years old,<br/>
He is not able to understand religion and politics,<br/>
But ultimately, apart from the son, who could hold the kingdom?<br/>
But when the thought of what to do arose, he said to me, </p>
<p>ââ<em>Ema</em>! My boy, if this is what you want,<br/>
Who can better hold what is received from the father than the son?<br/>
Therefore, if you want the kingdom, I will give it to you.â </p>
<p>âThen he placed me on the royal throne,<br/>
Where, as regent, I converted the kingdom to the sacred Dharma.<br/>
Staying in that country for eighty human years,<br/>
I was renowned as Prince Kunkyong.<a href="#fn:55" id="fnref:55" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[55]</a> </p>
<p>âThen, focusing on ruling the kingdom<br/>
As the victorious one, the heir supreme,<br/>
I returned once again to Zahor,<br/>
Resolving back into the heart of Padmasambhava. </p>
<p>âAfter King VihÄradhÄra died,<br/>
I held the reins of the kingdom<br/>
For three hundred and fifteen years<br/>
After establishing myself in the form Prince Kunkyong. </p>
<p>âThen, I thought that the kingdom of Bhaá¹ga<a href="#fn:56" id="fnref:56" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[56]</a> was ready to be tamed.<br/>
All of the lords and subjects of that country,<br/>
King Tumden<a href="#fn:57" id="fnref:57" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[57]</a> and his host of ministers,<br/>
Supported the six types of Extremist teachers. </p>
<p>âIn Kyemo Grove,<a href="#fn:58" id="fnref:58" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[58]</a> a most delightful place,<br/>
á¸Äkas and á¸ÄkinÄ«s transformed into humans<br/>
And I appeared to turn the Dharma Wheel to their assembly. </p>
<p>âLacking respect, the wealthy King Tumchen scolded:<a href="#fn:59" id="fnref:59" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[59]</a><br/>
âA Ho! Sweet-talking ascetic swindler!<br/>
Arriving here, in my realm,<br/>
You dare to give a stream of explanations.<br/>
You attempt to dilute and corrupt our doctrines.<br/>
If you donât leave this very moment,<br/>
You will be flayed alive and boiled in water.<br/>
Therefore, get out and go back to your own land.â </p>
<p>âIn response, I said, âYou Extremist!<br/>
These are the heretical teachings of MÄra.<br/>
You are a mere murderer, hurling the kingdom into the lower realms.<br/>
Therefore, I have come here<br/>
To convert all your lands to my teaching.<br/>
King, you are under my power.â </p>
<p>âAt my words, the King was apoplectic.<br/>
The evil-doers of that country, the evil demons, seized me.<br/>
They kept me in a wretched prison for seven years,<br/>
Where various strange sufferings befell me. </p>
<p>âFinally, he commanded, âBoil him alive in water!â<br/>
But though the ministers bound<br/>
My feet and hands in iron, they could not hold me.<br/>
They said, âCarry him away and throw him on an elephant.â </p>
<p>âThe ministers lifted me up,<br/>
But, like trying to heave Mount Meru, they couldnât carry me.<br/>
Following the royal command to kill me,<br/>
The ministers struck me with various weapons,<br/>
But due to the indestructible Vajra-like SamÄdhi,<a href="#fn:60" id="fnref:60" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[60]</a><br/>
Their weapons shattered without harming me at all. </p>
<p>âThe King thought,<br/>
âHow can this arrogant one be unassailable?<br/>
Since he cannot be controlled and is unpredictable,<br/>
I must summon my teachers, those worthy of worship.<br/>
If he can be vanquished through debate, we can banish him â<br/>
There is no skilful recourse apart from that.â </p>
<p>âThe religious traditions of the kingdom,<br/>
The six groups of Extremists<br/>
And the Extremist teachers were defeated in debate.<br/>
They said, âNow, we must compete with various miracles!â </p>
<p>âIn the contest of miracles, the Extremists were again defeated.<br/>
They said, âNow, we must compete through power and ability,â<br/>
And the Extremists retreated to the sandalwood forest. </p>
<p>When it was time to prove my powers,<br/>
I spat saliva on the tip of my outstretched finger,<a href="#fn:61" id="fnref:61" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[61]</a><br/>
And cast it to to the sky, towards the black planetary demon<a href="#fn:62" id="fnref:62" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[62]</a><br/>
Who was surrounded by the oath-bound ones of the Eight Classes.<br/>
As summoned, they filled the sky, and with twelve great thunderbolts<br/>
Crushed to dust the Extremists and their retinues. </p>
<p>âAt that, the King was supremely amazed<br/>
And he converted his kingdom to the holy Dharma.<br/>
Both King and ministers offered the kingdom to me. </p>
<p>âAt that time I said,<br/>
âI have no need for this kingdom.<br/>
Like foxes and monkeys, the Extremists<br/>
Deceive sentient beings and block the various paths to liberation. </p>
<p>ââTherefore, in order to lock the gates to the lower realms<br/>
And establish all of this kingdomâs subjects on the path to liberation,<br/>
I donât have a hairâs breadth of selfish ambition<br/>
Apart from appearing here in order to benefit being.â<br/>
The King and ministers rejoiced at this<br/>
And the entire kingdom of Bhaá¹ga was established in the doctrine. </p>
<p>âThen I thought that the kingdom of VedalÄ« was ready to be tamed.<br/>
VedalÄ«âs king, Kunthub,<a href="#fn:63" id="fnref:63" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[63]</a> was an eloquent speaker.<br/>
He saw the sun falling on the edge of the palace<br/>
As he was revelling with his foreign and domestic ministers.<br/>
Just then a light rain began to fall in the sunlight<br/>
From rainbow clouds amassing in the sky. </p>
<p>âThen the King said,<br/>
âHow wondrous! Listen, wise ones,<br/>
Today my mind has been calmed â<br/>
A joyful bliss arises, the likes of which I have never known!<br/>
Heaven, earth, and space display this elemental omen.<br/>
Such a spectacle as this has never happened before!<br/>
What do you all think? Please, speak!â </p>
<p>âThen great minister Dondrub<a href="#fn:64" id="fnref:64" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[64]</a> spoke:<br/>
âExcellent! Just as the great King has said,<br/>
I feel a similar experience of joyful bliss.<br/>
I wonder, Your Majesty, is this the miracle of a god such as ÄªÅvara?<a href="#fn:65" id="fnref:65" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[65]</a><br/>
Or is it a momentous sign or vision of a deity or protector<br/>
Arising due to the great Kingâs offerings<br/>
And practices of approach and accomplishment?â </p>
<p>âThen, in the sky, before the King and his ministers,<br/>
Red and rainbow light converged â and in the middle of a pavilion<br/>
I miraculously appeared as MaheÅvara.<a href="#fn:66" id="fnref:66" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[66]</a> </p>
<p>At the moment I appeared, all prostrated, saying,<br/>
âHow wondrous! No one is more fortunate than us!<br/>
By beholding your form, an outer happiness arises.<br/>
We will certainly fulfil your every command!<br/>
We offer our bodies, wealth, and our children and spouses â<br/>
Accept these offerings, do not leave us! Protect us all!â </p>
<p>âSo they made such vows and oaths.<br/>
âWhether or not you are truly MaheÅvara,<br/>
You must teach us!â<br/>
And faithfully they joined their palms in homage. </p>
<p>âThen, displaying my own form, I said,<br/>
âI am the MÄra-subduing Padmasambhava.<a href="#fn:67" id="fnref:67" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[67]</a><br/>
In all kingdoms of India<br/>
The profane, perverted doctrines of Extremists proliferate,<br/>
Leading mistaken beings to the lower realms. </p>
<p>âTherefore, I work only for the benefit of beings.<br/>
After converting your kingdom to the doctrine,<br/>
I will make this a place where disciples are liberated.<br/>
King and ministers, take this to heart!â </p>
<p>âThe great King said, âAlas!<br/>
As you say, in our minds, we think,<br/>
Now, although the King and ministers<br/>
Gathered here have taken these oaths,<br/>
These Extremists possess great ability and miraculous powers.<br/>
If we were actually to enter the gateway of your teachings<br/>
They will harm not only your life, but our kingdom as well.<br/>
You must therefore compete through debate and miraculous display.â </p>
<p>âOn the tenth day of the Month of Miracles<a href="#fn:68" id="fnref:68" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[68]</a><br/>
The Extremists were defeated in debate, and we competed in miracles.<br/>
Competing in the eight common siddhis, we were equal. </p>
<p>âThen, miracles of the five elements were called for.<br/>
I emanated the five elements<br/>
And bound the Extremists,<br/>
Who, astonished, entered the teachings of Buddhism<br/>
And the whole kingdom was converted to the sacred Dharma. </p>
<p>âThen I saw that the kingdom of Thokar<a href="#fn:69" id="fnref:69" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[69]</a> should be tamed.<br/>
Duly, when the tenth day of the tiger month arrived,<br/>
Aided by the dÌ£aÌkinÌ£iÌ Sangchen Wangmo,<a href="#fn:70" id="fnref:70" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[70]</a><br/>
With the blessings of one hundred thousand formless dÌ£aÌkinÌ£iÌs.<br/>
Miraculously flying through the air,<br/>
I went to the SindÅ«ra Cave.<a href="#fn:71" id="fnref:71" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[71]</a> </p>
<p>âEmissaries commissioned by the King addressed me:<br/>
âHere in our land there are only non-Buddhists;<br/>
Buddhists are not permitted to teach.<br/>
Because this edict is ironclad,<br/>
Your tradition is not suitable â therefore you must leave now.<br/>
If you stay, you will be killed in accordance with the law.â </p>
<p>âIn response to this, I said,<br/>
âI have come for a higher purpose.<br/>
Because my body is unborn and deathless, though you may kill me, I have no fear.<br/>
Because my mind is free of hope and fear, your laws do not frighten me.<br/>
Because any place is neither good nor bad, I will stay in this cave.<br/>
Because there is no work apart from the Dharma, I have abandoned worldly activities.<br/>
I will not follow the perverted views of Extremists.<br/>
King, whatever you do, you must understand this. </p>
<p>ââMessengers, when you tell this to the King,<br/>
His Majesty will be irate, quivering with a rising rage.<br/>
Assembling his hosts of ministers, he will say,<br/>
âDestroy this foreign yogi, this barbarian infidel!<br/>
Who knows where he comes from? How dare he come here!<br/>
Let him teach when he is burning in fire.â </p>
<p>âThen all the ministers said,<br/>
âBind him to sandalwood doused with sesame oil â<br/>
Everyone should carry a load!â </p>
<p>âAnd so, having carried the fuel, they placed me in the centre of the pyre.<br/>
But, in the very place where I should have been burning,<br/>
The gathered Extremists heard a resounding, âHa ha!â </p>
<p>When nine days had passed,<br/>
They saw me arise as the wrathful Nangsi ZilnÃ¶n<a href="#fn:72" id="fnref:72" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[72]</a><br/>
Soaring in the sky to a height of seven cubits,<br/>
Surrounded by á¸Äkas and dÌ£aÌkinÌ£iÌs, all offering respect. </p>
<p>âThe King and ministers confessed with remorse and sorrow,<br/>
And offered the kingdom and all its riches to me.<br/>
The Extremists respectfully prostrated, saying,<br/>
âWhatever you command, we will obediently fulfil!â<br/>
Reneging on their oaths and prior proclamations<br/>
They invited me to the royal palace,<br/>
And the kingdom was converted to the virtuous Dharma. </p>
<p>âThen, I went to the Kula Dzokpa charnel ground.
I was assisted there by the dÌ£aÌkinÌ£iÌ named WangdÃ¼ma,<a href="#fn:73" id="fnref:73" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[73]</a><br/>
And I bound to oath the mÄtá¹s, dÌ£aÌkinÌ£iÌs, gods, and demons<br/>
Who dwelled in the charnel ground, leading them to the path of Dharma. </p>
<p>âArriving at Akaniá¹£á¹­ha,<br/>
On the tenth day of the pig month,<br/>
I met the deity of timeless awareness, Samantabhadra-Vajradhara.<a href="#fn:74" id="fnref:74" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[74]</a><br/>
I requested explanations of all the teachings<br/>
Of the extremely secret, unsurpassed VajrayÄna.<br/>
I was renowned then as Kunzang PendÃ© Wangchuk.<a href="#fn:75" id="fnref:75" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[75]</a> </p>
<p>âOn the tenth day of the mouse month,<br/>
Arriving at the YangleshÃ¶ cave in Nepal,<br/>
I settled in the âOverwhelming Appearance and Existence with Splendour SamÄdhiâ<a href="#fn:76" id="fnref:76" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[76]</a><br/>
During the first watch of the night<br/>
I bound to oath King Takdong<a href="#fn:77" id="fnref:77" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[77]</a> and his seven siblings.<br/>
And I bound Hormo<a href="#fn:78" id="fnref:78" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[78]</a> and her nine relatives to oath at sunset.<br/>
At daybreak, I bound to oath the <em>theâurang</em> spirit LÃ¼kyong NÃ¶djin,<a href="#fn:79" id="fnref:79" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[79]</a><br/>
The Mamo Reti<a href="#fn:80" id="fnref:80" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[80]</a> and her nine relatives,<br/>
And the murderous Pelthog Gyalmo<a href="#fn:81" id="fnref:81" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[81]</a> and her three relatives. </p>
<p>âThen in the Meri Barwa charnel ground,<a href="#fn:82" id="fnref:82" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[82]</a><br/>
I was assisted by Ekajaá¹­Ä«, the Protectress of Mantra, the Queen of the All-Encompassing Space.<br/>
She instantly arrived though her miraculous power. </p>
<p>âI requested the empowerment, transmission, and instructions for the Rigdzin Lama<a href="#fn:83" id="fnref:83" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[83]</a> practice<br/>
From ShÃ¶nu Nampar RolpÃ© Wangpo.<a href="#fn:84" id="fnref:84" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[84]</a><br/>
I practiced it in the east, at the Raya StÅ«pa Grove,<a href="#fn:85" id="fnref:85" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[85]</a><br/>
And manifested the accomplishment of the practice. </p>
<p>âThen I arrived at Mount Aá¸akavatÄ«.<a href="#fn:86" id="fnref:86" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[86]</a><br/>
Where I was assisted by the goddess PramohÄ.<a href="#fn:87" id="fnref:87" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[87]</a><br/>
From VajrapÄá¹i, the Lord of Secrets,<br/>
I requested empowerment, transmission, and instructions for Jigten ChÃ¶to. <a href="#fn:88" id="fnref:88" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[88]</a>
Practicing in the JikjÃ© charnel ground,<a href="#fn:89" id="fnref:89" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[89]</a><br/>
I became the ruler of the entire maá¹á¸ala of Jigten ChÃ¶to. </p>
<p>âThen I arrived at the Rangjung Tsal charnel ground.<a href="#fn:90" id="fnref:90" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[90]</a><br/>
While I practiced, I filled the entire area around the charnel ground<br/>
With hundreds of emanated phantoms,<br/>
And became the ruler over all of the infinite maá¹á¸alas. </p>
<p>âThen I arrived at the Khandro Sangphuk cave at Tak Dzong Grove,<a href="#fn:91" id="fnref:91" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[91]</a><br/>
In the Jikrung Ngamji charnel ground.<a href="#fn:92" id="fnref:92" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[92]</a><br/>
Again, I practiced VajrakÄ«la.<br/>
After six months, the maá¹á¸ala deities<br/>
Appeared in the sky, and dissolved into my body. </p>
<p>âAs two separate miraculous emanations,<br/>
I went to both China and Mongolia<a href="#fn:93" id="fnref:93" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[93]</a> simultaneously.<br/>
I indentured malevolent gods and demons, binding them to oath,<br/>
And converted entire kingdoms to the virtuous Dharma. </p>
<p>âOnce again, back at the Tak Dzong Cave,<a href="#fn:94" id="fnref:94" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[94]</a> I merged back into one form.<br/>
The teacher and yidam united, and, on account of my wild wrath,<br/>
My name then was Guru Dorje DrolÃ¶,<br/>
As I bound to oath the eight classes of planetary and <em>tsen</em> spirits. </p>
<p>âThen I practiced in the grove at the Jarung Khashor StÅ«pa<a href="#fn:95" id="fnref:95" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[95]</a><br/>
And the hosts of á¸ÄkinÄ«s urged me to prophesy.<br/>
So I said, âFive hundred years from now, in the time of degeneration,<br/>
Border barbarians will destroy the Buddhaâs teachings.<br/>
One follower of yours will come in the time of degeneration,<br/>
And there will be six hidden lands.<br/>
Pray that he will appear through the power of the Miraculous SamÄdhi.â<br/>
In saying this, I gave a weighty prophecy. </p>
<p>âThen I went to the Serung rock cave<a href="#fn:96" id="fnref:96" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[96]</a><br/>

<p>âOnce again, I returned to India,<br/>

<p><em>This is the fourth chapter of the biography of Padma that naturally liberates on sight, on how he came to the pure lands of India and Nepal through miraculous powers, perfectly accomplishing the two types of benefit.</em> </p>
<h4>Chapter 5</h4>
<p>âThen, Trisong Detsen, Emperor of the impure Tibetan lands<br/>
Instructed Trisher of the Yarlung Ba clan<a href="#fn:114" id="fnref:114" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[114]</a><br/>
To carry one bre of gold dust in an ornamented bowl<br/>
And invite me, TsokyÃ© Dorje to come.<br/>
The messenger, as instructed,<br/>
Offered me gold dust in a golden vessel. </p>
<p>âAlthough I already knew, I asked, âWho are you?â<br/>
Joining his hands in reverence he replied,<br/>
âI am Trisher of the Bami clan of Yarlung,<br/>
In Pur Gyal,<a href="#fn:115" id="fnref:115" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[115]</a> the kingdom of Tibet. </p>
<p>ââAlthough formerly known as bellicose and thieving,<br/>
The Emperor of Tibet, Trisong Detsen,<br/>
Has subjugated and united all the thirty-two regions.<br/>
Now, he wishes to perform spiritual activities.<br/>
Please consider his letter of invitation.â </p>
<p>âSince I had received the letter, I had to go to Tibet.<br/>
I replied to him, âSince you are a human<br/>
With a corporeal body of flesh and blood,<br/>
You would be attacked and killed by those spirits who oppose me.<br/>
It wouldnât be right to return there together. </p>
<p>ââTibet is the domain of demons and cannibals.<br/>
If you do not have a body of light like mine,<br/>
Free of cruel thoughts and acts â the ripening of past misdeeds â<br/>
People with normal bodies find it difficult to overcome them.<br/>
So, I will follow behind as you go ahead.<br/>
Relate this to the Emperor and take the letter to him.â </p>
<p>âAll the gods and demons of Tibet<br/>
Would have attacked me, life and limb,<br/>
But I bound them under oaths, entrusted them with treasures,<br/>
And empowered them through magic as protectors of the Buddhaâs teachings. </p>
<p>âAfter bestowing a name and a command, and sealing them with my vajra,<br/>
I placed a casket of precious treasure in their hands.<br/>
Emanating a treasury of inexhaustible enjoyments that filled space,<br/>
I commissioned them to protect the Secret Mantra teachings. </p>
<p>I said, âAll you defiled gods and demons will be punished later.<br/>
My successors will invoke these bonds,<br/>
And enforce the command that you are under an oath of service<br/>
With the four types of awakened activity.â<a href="#fn:116" id="fnref:116" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[116]</a> </p>
<p>âThen, when I reached Tibet,<br/>
The Emperor, his ministers, and subjects came to meet me<br/>
And they were ecstatic as they welcomed me.<br/>
I thought, âI must convert the Emperor and his subjects<br/>
By displaying various miracles that will generate faith!â </p>
<p>âThrough myriad unobstructed miracles<br/>
The misguided Emperor and his ministers<br/>
Abandoned the afflictions and darkness of their minds. </p>
<p>âThey listened to my commands, and with faith and devotion, they fulfilled them.<br/>
Because only heretic teachers<a href="#fn:117" id="fnref:117" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[117]</a> inhabited this land of Tibet,<br/>
No teachers of the holy Dharma were allowed to stay there. </p>
<p>âThe Emperor Trisong Detsen<br/>
Arranged a seat of silken cushions, piled nine high.<br/>
Then the great monarch<br/>
Prepared a golden maá¹á¸ala<br/>
And filled it with heaps of turquoise and gems. </p>
<p>âHe prostrated, joined his palms, and respectfully requested:<br/>
âMy kingdom is a land of demons and defiled beings.<br/>
Previously I was a ruler in the heretic tradition.<br/>
I committed evil actions, and I did not propagate the sacred Dharma. </p>
<p>ââDuring the reign of Emperor Thori Nyantsan,<a href="#fn:118" id="fnref:118" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[118]</a><br/>
VajrapÄá¹i, the Lord of Secrets,<br/>
Initiated an auspicious interdependent connection<br/>
By miraculously granting him symbols of awakened form, speech, and mind. </p>
<p>ââIn the reign of Emperor Songtsen Gampo,<br/>
Who was cared for by Ärya MahÄkaruá¹a,<a href="#fn:119" id="fnref:119" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[119]</a><br/>
The three supports were installed in the temple, the foundation of the teachings.<br/>
The Emperor gave many instructions<br/>
For the stages of generation and completion of the secret method<br/>
To a few of his ministers, enabling them to experience bliss. </p>
<p>ââThen, Emperor Tride Tsuktsen<a href="#fn:120" id="fnref:120" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[120]</a><br/>
Began laying the foundations for the teaching of the holy Dharma.<br/>
However, due to the powers and curses of the heretics,<br/>
He âdissolved into spaceâ when he was twenty-eight years old. </p>
<p>ââSo I waged war with their rulers<br/>
From age fifteen to twenty-four,<br/>
Subjugating the thirty regions of the world. </p>
<p>ââThen in my dreams, Vajra DhÄtviÅvarÄ«,<a href="#fn:121" id="fnref:121" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[121]</a> the á¸ÄkinÄ« of awareness,<br/>
Displayed a form like fifteen rising moons, and said:<br/>
â<em>Kye ma</em>! O Dear! This evil leaderâs actions<br/>
Are the accumulated causes of the sufferings of endless saá¹sÄra.<br/>
Your accumulated negative actions will lead you to deep, fiery prisons.<br/>
Who will rescue you from that such an inescapable, piteous time?â </p>
<p>ââThough she glared at me with menacing eyes,<br/>
I said, âExcellent, O Compassionate One!<br/>
Pray, tell me whether this heretic kingdom of mine<br/>
Is proper or improper.â </p>
<p>ââIn response the á¸ÄkinÄ« said,<br/>
âThis âheretic lineageâ is only the teaching of MÄra, a perverted path.<br/>
As soon as its followers die, they are reborn as demons and malevolent spirits<br/>
Who attack the life-force of sentient beings.<br/>
In the end they will surely fall to the Hell of Ceaseless Torment.â<a href="#fn:122" id="fnref:122" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[122]</a> </p>
<p>ââI said, âVery well then.<br/>
Since the heretic teachings are a cause for lower rebirths,<br/>
What method is there to gain liberation? What must I do?â </p>
<p>ââWhen I asked this, the á¸ÄkinÄ« said:<br/>
âConquer all the charnel grounds and pilgrimage places<br/>
Of all of the kingdoms of the noble land of India.<br/>
When you have bound to oath all guardians of the teachings and places, and gods and demons of all that appears and exists,<br/>
And when you have banished Extremists and holders of wrong views from all kingdoms,<br/>
Then everyone will come to know bliss.â </p>
<p>ââAfter the teacher, ÅÄkyamuni, arrives,<br/>
The splendour of the disciples will arise from the all-encompassing space of phenomena. </p>
<p>ââIf you invite the one known<br/>
As Guru Pema JungnÃ©,<br/>
You can be sure that the kingdom of Tibet<br/>
Will convert to the pure Dharma.â </p>
<p>ââAnd so, I acted in accordance with that dream.<br/>
Give me a method for converting my kingdom to the dharma<br/>
And hold me with your compassion!â </p>
<p>âSo spoke the Emperor. In response, I advised:<br/>
âFirst, in a temple, the foundation for the teachings,<br/>
Raise many supports of awakened form, speech, and mind,<br/>
And train many Tibetan youths in secular knowledge. </p>
<p>ââNext, commission the translations of the Indian teachings.<br/>
Although I hold the teachings and lineages of the Buddha,<br/>
And all written commentarial teachings<br/>
Have merged in me like streams in the ocean,<br/>
And I understand them all, I can not spread them. </p>
<p>âIn order to secure the foundation of the Buddhaâs teachings<br/>
You must invite Khenchen Bodhisattva,<a href="#fn:123" id="fnref:123" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[123]</a><br/>
The Buddha disguised in human form,<br/>
Lord of all the learned and accomplished translators of the Noble Land,<br/>
The genuine one in whom all lineage holders place their trust,<br/>
The glorious Lord of the activity of training those to be trained.â </p>
<p>âIn response, the Emperor said,<br/>
âIâm not sure if I can invite the great abbot.<br/>
If it can be done, then to whom should I send the letter?<br/>
Great master, I request you foretell<br/>
Whether we have the good fortune for him to come here.â </p>
<p>âI advised, âKye Ho!<br/>
Listen, sovereign Dharma King!<br/>
Due to the powerful past aspirations of four children<br/>
We presently have the fortune of meeting again.<a href="#fn:124" id="fnref:124" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[124]</a><br/>
If the Ba from Yarlung were to invite him, that would be excellent.â<br/>
As suggested, the Ba clansman was sent to invite him to Tibet<br/>
In order to expand the extent of the Buddhaâs teachings. </p>
<p>âThen, I, Padma JungnÃ©, through the strength of my samÄdhi,<br/>
Summoned á¸Äkas and á¸ÄkinÄ«s<br/>
From the twenty-four Great Places, the thirty-two Sacred Places,<br/>
The hundred and eight Charnel Grounds, and the ten Heruka sites. </p>
<p>âSummoning the gods that surround the four great kingdoms,<br/>
And all the eight classes of oath-bound gods and demons<br/>
With the All-embracing Display SamÄdhi<a href="#fn:125" id="fnref:125" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[125]</a><br/>
I appointed them as emissaries under my command. </p>
<p>âI bound under oath foul nÄgas, mÄras and murderous spirits<br/>
To seize and tame the land, and raise glorious SamyÃ©.<br/>
After that, the master and disciples performed the consecration,<br/>
And I entrusted Gyalpo Pehar as the lord of the place. </p>
<p>âAfter many young Tibetans were trained in secular sciences,<br/>
The teachings from all over India and China<br/>
Were transmitted to Tibet in their entirety.<br/>
Finally, many paá¹á¸its and siddhas were invited<br/>
To clarify doubts about the teachings. </p>
<p>âQueen Tsepong Zawa Margyan,<a href="#fn:126" id="fnref:126" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[126]</a><br/>
The embodiment of the Glorious Goddess, ÅrÄ« DevÄ«<a href="#fn:127" id="fnref:127" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[127]</a><br/>
Displayed various actions so that she appeared to be a follower of the heretics.<br/>
Buddhists and heretics debated, and the heretics were defeated.<br/>
Finally, she produced the method for destroying the heretic tradition. </p>
<p>âThen, general teachings of the Secret Mantra VajrayÄna were given,<br/>
And in particular, the doctrine of the Great Perfection.<br/>
Siddhas who renounced this life, and practiced the essence<br/>
In caverns, grottoes, and desolate places<br/>
Filled all of the mountain slopes and valleys<br/>
Throughout all the lands of Tibet. </p>
<p>âFive hundred years in the future, in the degenerate time, holy teachers and students<br/>
Will find the circumstances for the succession of practice lineages severed.<br/>
The thirty-two blessings of the common teachings will have dissipated. </p>
<p>âAlthough practice will be undertaken, there will be no signs of accomplishment.<br/>
Therefore, I have concealed many teachings as treasures.<br/>
After my own rebirth among humans, these treasures will be revealed. </p>
<p>âAfter teaching many fortunate disciples, saying,<br/>
âBoundless benefit will be accomplished for beings!â<br/>
I will fill all the lands of Tibet with treasure teachings.<br/>
In future times, they will be revealed, and prophecies will be foretold. </p>
<p>ââTsogyal, you are actually Khorlo Gyedeb:<a href="#fn:128" id="fnref:128" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[128]</a><br/>
The consort of the one who has accomplished the KÄ«la of Timeless Awareness.<a href="#fn:129" id="fnref:129" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[129]</a><br/>
Spread these indestructible, inexhaustible treasures far and wide,<br/>
Concealed in the womb of the five elements.<br/>
Enjoin the host of arrogant oath-bound protectors<br/>
To keep these secret from unfortunate or unsuitable people,<br/>
And to spread this inexhaustible profundity beyond depth or limit!â<br/>
After I had so ordered, I affixed the seal in accordance with the command, and hid them. </p>
<p>âAfterwards I hid twenty-five representations,<br/>
Making aspirations for the subjugation of the frontier barbarians<br/>
During the lives of those treasure-revealers who would discover them,<br/>
And I also applied the seal of awakened mind. </p>
<p>âSome of the treasure-revealers will have four wives each.<br/>
Some will be ignoble beings, others virtuous â one canât be sure who will reveal treasures.<br/>
Therefore, I will give them to my emanations.<br/>
These were my fervent aspirations.â </p>
<p><em>This is the fifth chapter of the biography of Padma that naturally liberates on sight, on how he accomplished the benefit of beings in Tibet and expanded the reach of the teachings.</em> </p>

<p>Then I said, âWhile the Emperorâs life is not yet over,<br/>

By many methods for taming beings,<br/>
You must not go elsewhere. </p>
<p>âWhen the Emperor has passed into nirvÄá¹a,<br/>

<p><em>This is the sixth chapter of the biography of Padma that naturally liberates on sight, on how he bound the gods and demons under oath in all realms of Tibet, and gave prophecy after blessing sacred places.</em> </p>
<h4>Chapter 7</h4>
<p>Then the Emperor Trisong Detsen said,<br/>
â<em>Ema</em>! Compassionate Protector,<br/>
The shining lamp of the sacred Dharma<br/>
Has illuminated all areas of this dark Tibet. </p>
<p>âThe benefit of beings is consummated by the spread of the teachings.<br/>
Thus, now I will propagate the Eight Practice Lineages<a href="#fn:205" id="fnref:205" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[205]</a><br/>
Until I am fifty-nine years old. </p>
<p>âNow, it would be excellent if I could practice<br/>
The precious teachings on sÅ«tra and mantra like that.<br/>
Precious Orgyen, I pray, give me direction! </p>
<p>âMy ancestors who have left this world have demonstrated causality,<br/>
And this must also be shown to future generations.<br/>
Please instruct us, O compassionate Protector!â </p>
<p>For a moment Orgyen Rinpoche rested in silent contemplation.<br/>
Then he answered,<br/>
âNow the paá¹á¸itas and siddhas of India and China<br/>
Must be pleased with your countryâs tributary offering.<br/>
But the Emperor and all of his subjects must strive in practice,<br/>
So that the sovereign Emperor, the Dharma King, and all his subjects attain realization.â </p>
<p>The Emperor replied,<br/>
â<em>Kye ma</em>! Padmasambhava, protector of beings,<br/>
All my aspirations are fulfilled. </p>
<p>âGlorious SamyÃ©, the foundation for the teachings, has arisen naturally.<br/>
Tibet now has wise and accomplished beings<br/>
Like the great translator Vairotsana, and many others </p>
<p>âThe entire ocean of the classes of sÅ«tra, mantra, and tantra<br/>
Have spread in Tibet owing to your compassion.<br/>
The rising sun has illuminated the dark island of Tibet.<br/>
Now, all my aspirations are fulfilled. </p>
<p>âUntil my royal lineage is no more,<br/>
Remain as our sole protector, and hold us with your compassion.<br/>
If the Master were to depart to the land of the cannibal demons,<br/>
The people of Tibet would have no protector for their hopes.<br/>
O compassionate one, donât let your compassion dissipate!â </p>
<p>In response, Orgyen Rinpoche replied:<br/>
âListen, wise Emperor and ministers of Tibet!<br/>
I shall not stay; I am going to the land of the cannibal demons.<br/>
If the savage cannibal demons are not subdued,<br/>
The entire world will fall into ruin and decline. </p>
<p>âThere is no one who can subdue them besides me.<br/>
On the summit of the Copper-coloured Mountain, in the centre of CÄmara Island<a href="#fn:206" id="fnref:206" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[206]</a><br/>
Are inconceivable pure realms, miraculously emanated.<br/>
There I will settle and emanate immeasurable manifestations. </p>
<p>âIn billions of world-systems,<br/>
Billions of emanations of Padmasambhava<br/>
Will tame beings who are ripe for taming through expedient means. </p>
<p>âMy retinue of disciples â the Emperor and ministers who embrace virtue â<br/>
Will certainly be reborn into my pure realm.<br/>
Previously I have only told my life story briefly.<br/>
But now, as the times grow gradually worse,<br/>
There would be no benefit, even if I stayed here forever. </p>
<p>âThough I was very kind to Tibet, my kindness will not be remembered.<br/>
In subduing all the malicious demons of dark Tibet,<br/>
I have acted beneficially for many future generations. </p>
<p>âFacing great difficulties,<br/>
I abolished the savage, heretical teachings<br/>
And converted Tibet to the sacred Dharma.<br/>
I travelled through all places and regions of Tibet,<br/>
Bestowing consecrations and blessings, and making aspirations. </p>
<p>âFrom now on, the teachings will quickly spread.<br/>
In future times, they will gradually degenerate,<br/>
And many different traditions will gradually proliferate. </p>
<p>âNegative deeds will be widespread, at odds with the Dharma.<br/>
Holders of the mantra tradition will engage in worldly activities,<br/>
And there wonât be anyone who manages even one year of retreat. </p>
<p>âMonastics wonât guard even a single vow,<br/>
But will continuously chase after profit<br/>
While secretly resorting to lovers, as do dogs and pigs. </p>
<p>âAt that time, I cannot offer any help.<br/>
Occasionally, when the time arises<br/>
For a group of fortunate ones to assemble,<br/>
An emanation of mine, a treasure-revealer, will come,<br/>
Guiding those disciples on the path to liberation. </p>
<p>âParticularly, at the end of five hundred years of degeneration,<br/>
Barbarians from the borderlands will descend on the central lands,<br/>
Deceiving the minds of all people. </p>
<p>âConflict, strife and myriad weapons will spread;<br/>
Bandits and brigands will pour in from the hills. </p>
<p>âPeople will only have confidence in themselves.<br/>
Various random epidemics â the fury of the mÄtá¹s<br/>
And the meddling of the nyen â will cause death. </p>
<p>âAt that time, to gather together the remaining disciples,<br/>
I will emanate as Dudjom Dorje<a href="#fn:207" id="fnref:207" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[207]</a><br/>
And establish one thousand and eight hundred disciples in bliss. </p>
<p>âThe entourage of students â emanations of the current Emperor and subjects â<br/>
Will do auspicious work among their heart-disciples.<br/>
When connected with the path of liberation, they will enter the path of the Dharma. </p>
<p>âAt that time, through the power of the barbarians<br/>
The teachings of black MÄra will cover the land.<br/>
Perverted aspirations will be fulfilled in an instant,<br/>
And, through myriad negative actions,<br/>
Sentient beings will suffer unpredictably, like a changing dance.<br/>
Who could give the methods for reversing this? </p>
<p>âTherefore, Emperor and subjects, you must master your minds.<br/>
The subjects, all, must now make great efforts<br/>
In observing the holy discipline of the Dharma. </p>
<p>âLife is impermanent, a temporary dream.<br/>
So cut all clinging to permanence, Emperor and subjects! </p>
<p>âWealth is impermanent, like an illusory gathering,<br/>
So strive to make extensive offerings, Emperor and subjects! </p>
<p>âActivities are endless, like a painting, perpetually unfurling,<br/>
So practice the holy teachings â the end quickly approaches! </p>
<p>âMarriage is impermanent, like people in a marketplace,<br/>
So donât quarrel or fight, but apply yourselves to the teachings! </p>
<p>âThe royal court is impermanent, like a city of gandharvas,<br/>
So donât engage in infighting, Emperor and subjects! </p>
<p>âOffer whatever you can afford to practitioners in retreat,<br/>
And you will obtain an equal share of merit, Emperor and subjects! </p>
<p>âSatisfy the weak and feeble by distributing food,<br/>
And your merit â the provision for future journeys â will thereby increase. </p>
<p>âRely on the Refuge, the Three Jewels, never separating from them,<br/>
And later, guides for the path will come, Emperor and subjects! </p>
<p>âOffer as much as you can before the Three Supports,<a href="#fn:208" id="fnref:208" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[208]</a><br/>
And later, just as much wealth will again be accumulated. </p>
<p>âEven if you have food and riches, contentment will never arise,<br/>
So always hold to the key point of reliance on contentment. </p>
<p>âSustain the royal laws with the Dharma.<br/>
Ministers, amend the laws in accordance with the Emperorâs commands. </p>
<p>âMeditators, resort to solitary mountain retreats.<br/>
Ngakpas, protect your commitments as you would your life.<br/>
Monastics, protect your vows of discipline.<br/>
Ngakpas, exert yourselves purely in retreat practice. </p>
<p>âLaypeople, abandon all deception and guile,<br/>
And at all times exert yourselves in reciting the six syllables.<a href="#fn:209" id="fnref:209" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[209]</a><br/>
Never forget the uncertainty of the time of death, Emperor and subjects! </p>
<p>âIn this and future lives, there is no refuge or protector besides the teacher,<br/>
So donât forget your teachers and always revere them,<br/>
Continuously making offerings and supplications.<br/>
Later, we will meet again, Emperor and subjects! </p>
<p>âNow, I must again go to Taktsang Sengphuk.<br/>
After a while spent there,<br/>
I will return to a few places in Tibet, to practice.â </p>
<p>At that, the Emperor, ministers, and subjects<br/>
Decided they would rather not remain in Tibet,<br/>
But would return, dejected, to their own lands. </p>
<p>Then the Dharma King Trisong Detsen said,<br/>
âWhen will come time for the rediscovery of your life-story<br/>
And this secret Heart-Drop of the á¸ÄkinÄ«?<a href="#fn:210" id="fnref:210" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[210]</a><br/>
Who will the treasure-revealer be?<br/>
What will be the joys and concerns of that time?<br/>
What will people be like at that time?<br/>
Precious Orgyen, I pray you tell us!â </p>
<p>And in response, precious Orgyen said,<br/>
âListen, sovereign of Tibet, Dharma King!<br/>
All existent teachings of sÅ«tra and mantra<br/>
Are contained within my teachings. </p>
<p>âAlthough Tibet lies within my field of influence,<br/>
There are savage creatures who transgress the oaths<br/>
Who encounter adversity through contradicting the teacher and teachings.<br/>
In this region I have given instructions, empowerments, transmissions, and treasures. </p>
<p>âThe common blessings of the teachings will decline if the lineage is broken.<br/>
Therefore, the treasure-revealers, my emanations,<br/>
Will occasionally appear as ngakpas, sometimes as householders,<br/>
And some will appear as women. </p>
<p>âWhen those with pure vision receive empowerments, transmissions,<br/>
And instructions of this close lineage, they will be able to reverse the negative karma of guile and conflict,<br/>
And the first of one hundred treasure-revealers,<br/>
Named SangyÃ© Lama will appear.<a href="#fn:211" id="fnref:211" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[211]</a><br/>
Thereafter, the hundred main treasure-revealers will come in succession. </p>
<p>âIn the meantime, some revealers will train disciples.<br/>
Sometimes temporary situations of conflict will be quelled.<br/>
At the end of the five hundred years of degeneration,<br/>
In NÄlandÄ monastery,<br/>
The mistaken aspiration of GeshÃ© Pelseng will ripen.<a href="#fn:212" id="fnref:212" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[212]</a><br/>
And the spread of the non-Buddhist barbarians will be reversed twice. </p>
<p>âThey will collapse, but, among the embers in Bu, some will still propitiate<br/>
the spirit Hanuman.<a href="#fn:213" id="fnref:213" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[213]</a><br/>
By the strength of combining substances, mantra, and samÄdhi,<br/>
Many new practices will flourish. </p>
<p>âThese will spread by the strength of perverted aspirations of the present.<br/>
Monkey-headed <em>thâeurang</em> ministers,<br/>
And <em>shangpo</em> ministers with various types of heads<a href="#fn:214" id="fnref:214" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[214]</a><br/>
Will fight and repeatedly raise obstacles,<br/>
All as assisted by Hanuman. </p>
<p>âThe minds of all humans will be easily turned against the dharma.<br/>
Unsatisfied by the riches they have,<br/>
They will turn to theft and banditry.<br/>
Families will fight, and unhappiness will follow. </p>
<p>âAt that time, by the power of substances blessed by the perverted ones,<br/>
The sky will be the colour of blood for eighteen months.<br/>
The eight planets will align, and Ketu will be ascendant.<a href="#fn:215" id="fnref:215" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[215]</a> </p>
<p>âAt that time, beings will be beset by attachment<br/>
Because their strong desire to unite with lovers will have no cure.<br/>
Treasure-revealers with no treasure to show will cover the earth;<br/>
Few who even have practiced for one year will be seen. </p>
<p>âAll of the great treasure-revealers, my emanations,<br/>
Will protect all beings, supreme and inferior,<br/>
Showing them the path of liberation and connecting them with it. </p>
<p>âBecause charlatan âtreasure-revealersâ harbour worldly aims,<br/>
Like street dogs who never really relax,<br/>
They will get no satisfaction from the food and wealth they seek.<br/>
All sentient beings with rotten minds will follow after them. </p>
<p>âAll of the treasure-revealers, my emanations,<br/>
Should rely on various mountain ranges as supportive places.<br/>
All you fortunate ones connected to me by previous actions and aspirations,<br/>
You must strive to enter the path of liberation! </p>
<p>âThose who falsely claim to be my emanations,<br/>
Do not understand the view, their meditation is directly ruined,<br/>
And they have no ability to teach the Dharma to others.<br/>
Deceiving themselves and others, they hoard offerings and raise children.<br/>
All degenerate beings will have faith in people like these. </p>
<p>âAt that time the end of the teachings will arrive.<br/>
The essence and fruition of treasures and treatises will vanish.<br/>
Then, I myself will appear in Chakmo, in eastern Tibet<a href="#fn:216" id="fnref:216" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[216]</a><br/>
Among the outcaste and poor, as one known as Lha. </p>
<p>âIn order to teach the path to students, without regard to good and bad,<br/>
I will send an emanation, a poor outcaste,<br/>
Whoever is connected with me, the present Pema JungnÃ©,<br/>
The hosts of all laypeople, high and low without exception â<br/>
I myself will emanate to them in a human form,<br/>
As the guide who connects them to the path of liberation. </p>
<p>âLike my two eyes, my two heart sons â<br/>
Pelyang and SangyÃ© YeshÃ©<a href="#fn:217" id="fnref:217" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[217]</a><br/>
Will be like the array of stars adorning space,<br/>
And at that time, emanations of the Emperor and disciples will reappear. </p>
<p>âIn random mountains and valleys, one hundred and eighty people<br/>
Who are inclined to the essential practice<br/>
Will attain the confidence of fearlessness, and be liberated into dharmakÄya as rainbow bodies.<br/>
When the time comes for gathering the remaining disciples<br/>
All those fortunate ones connected to me through past karma<br/>
Will enter the path to liberation, the end of samsara. </p>
<p>âAt that time, shameless hypocrites<br/>
Will be praised by everyone.<br/>
Sublime holy beings who single-pointedly exert themselves in the essential practice<br/>
Will become the objects of attachment and anger. </p>
<p>âPeople will praise and take to be holy<br/>
Those who emanate as mÄras due to past negative activities.<br/>
Like throwing rocks and paving stones,<br/>
They will slander my emanations,<br/>
Who all exert themselves in the essential practice. </p>
<p>âAt that time, the teachings of MÄra will flourish.<br/>
Me, my emanations, and those two sublime beings<br/>
Will understand the signs of those supreme beingsâ teachings.<br/>
They will bear the knowledge-name and strength-name of the emanations<a href="#fn:218" id="fnref:218" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[218]</a><br/>
Of the present-day master from Nub, SangyÃ© YeshÃ©.<br/>
At a time when the high snow mountains are held by earth spirits,<br/>
In the west, upon the light-rays of the teachings of sÅ«tra and mantra<br/>
I will rapidly ascend to the pure Khecara realm.<br/>
Along with eighty-two disciples. </p>
<p>âTsogyal, you will hide<br/>
My concise biography<br/>
Along with three cycles of profound secret teachings<br/>
In the womb of Dorje Drak in symbolic script, as treasures,<a href="#fn:219" id="fnref:219" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[219]</a><br/>
Entrusting the gyalpo spirit Yutreng as the guardian.â<a href="#fn:220" id="fnref:220" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[220]</a> </p>
<p>Then, Emperor Trisong Detsen asked,<br/>
âWill you establish the teachings in all hidden lands,<br/>
Away from the demonic teachings of the perverted barbarians?â </p>
<p>The great Orgyen Rinpoche replied,<br/>
âThese hidden lands were entrusted<br/>
 To the six types of protectors of those treasures. </p>
<p>âFuture people will not falsely accuse you,<br/>
And the lives of the daring will be long.<br/>
Emperor, you yourself are a true emanation of MaÃ±juÅrÄ«,<br/>
And soon you will resolve back into MaÃ±juÅrÄ«âs heart. </p>
<p>âLater, barbaric teachings will not spread.<br/>
You and I will both return to protect the teachings and the people.<br/>
Though sentient beings are limitless in scope and number,<br/>
Sentient beings linked to me through aspirations and karma<br/>
Will be established on the level of total freedom beyond fear.â<br/>
At these words, Emperor Trisong Detsen rejoiced. </p>
<p><em>This is the seventh and final chapter of the biography of Padma that naturally liberates on sight, on how he gave direct instruction and prophecies of future times to the Emperor and his subjects.</em> </p>
