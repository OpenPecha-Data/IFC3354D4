	<h2>A Concise History of Orgyen Padmaâs Enlightened Deeds</h2>
<p><em>by Orgyen Lingpa</em></p>
<p>In the language of Uá¸á¸iyÄna: <em>Buddha Dharma Saá¹gha Dhaya</em><br/>
In the language of Tibet: <em>SangyÃ© ChÃ¶ Dang GendÃ¼n La Taktu GÃ¼pÃ© Chaktsal Lo</em><br/>
[In the English language: Homage and Devotion to the Buddha, Dharma and Saá¹gha!]</p>
<p>This story is a teaching on the life and liberation of<br/>
Pema JungnÃ©, guide of beings,<br/>
Who took birth for the benefit of those to be tamed.<br/>
It is a story to protect the dedicated, fortunate, and wise.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> </p>
<p>Emaho!</p>
<p>In the three-storeyed temple at SamyÃ©,<br/>
Offerings were made by Prince Mutri Tsenpo<br/>
To Padmasambhava seated on a throne of nine-layered silks,<br/>
To Khenpo ÅÄntaraká¹£ita on a throne of five-layered silks,<br/>
And to Vairocana and the three chief lotsawas,<br/>
On silken cushions to the right and left.<br/>
The prince offered an abundance of precious jewels<br/>
And, after many prostrations, spoke the following words: </p>
<p>âEmaho!</p>
<p>Great Son of the Victorious Ones, you who know the three times â<br/>
My lord and father, Trisong Deutsen, has passed away,<br/>
And you, beacon of the teachings, are leaving for the land of <em>rÄká¹£asas</em>,<br/>
Whilst we Tibetans are stuck with our short lives, fraught with distractions.<br/>
And so, in this final age, for those who remain,<br/>
I request a concise teaching on the sacred Dharmaâs meaning â<br/>
A powerful prayer to you, our Guru,<br/>
A summary of your life and liberation!â </p>
<p>The Guru then replied:<br/>
âListen well, Mutri Tsenpo!<br/>
Here is my concise teaching<br/>
In benefit for the future. </p>
<p>Emaho!</p>

features all of the following:</p>

Eight disciples who hold my lineage,<br/>

<p>This concludes the sixteenth chapter, <em>The Eight Revealers of My Treasures, who are Lords of the Dharma:</em></p>
<p>Emaho!</p>
<p>Listen well, great king!<br/>
I, Padma JungnÃ© possess the five mundane and the five super-mundane perceptions.<br/>
It is with these perceptions that I know and understand.<br/>
Previously, I have been the Buddha of Infinite Light, AmitÄbha, the Protector AvalokiteÅvara of Mount Potala, and Padma JungnÃ© of DhanakoÅa. Although these each arise as the expression of the three kÄyas, they are ultimately inseparable and indivisible.<br/>
Abiding in the <em>dharmadhÄtu</em> is Samantabhadra; in GhanavyÅ«ha is the great Vajradhara; and in Bodhgaya is the Great Sage himself.<a href="#fn:34" id="fnref:34" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[34]</a> Inseparably, they are all spontaneously accomplished within myself, Orgyen.<br/>
Therefore, always pray to me!<br/>
The kingâs descendants will be a hundred and thirteen in number, after which a Tartar emperor from China will lead an invading army into Tibet, laying to waste the people and the land, and destroying my temples.<br/>
At that time, there will be a man known as Sakya, an emanation of mine.<br/>
In the region of TÃ¶,<a href="#fn:35" id="fnref:35" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[35]</a> there will be a man named Jampal and a woman named Drolma.<br/>
They will be the parents of a son, Kunga Gyaltsen, Noble Protector of Beings.<br/>
He will rebuild my temples and spread the teachings of Secret Mantra far and wide, bringing happiness and wellbeing to the people of Tibet.<br/>
Later, greedy kings will take the throne, some of them acting like Dharma kings, and others like demons.<br/>
Some kings will establish the laws of Dharma, while others will destroy them.<br/>
During these times, people will constantly rise and fall.<br/>
An emanation of AtiÅa, foretold by the Buddha and known as Lobzang, will appear in the mountain ranges of Do Kham.<a href="#fn:36" id="fnref:36" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[36]</a> Through him, happiness and wellbeing will dawn once again in this land of Tibet, and virtuous people will regain courage.<br/>
A fort will be built in Lower Nyang at Nyima Do and a temple will be built on the red mountains at Lhasa.<br/>
Then, my emanation, Orgyen Lingpa will appear and reveal twenty-five treasures.â</p>
<p>At these words, the king began to weep.<br/>
Prostrating many times, and offering a maá¹á¸ala, he asked:<br/>
âGuide of beings, Great Teacher, please tell me of the future of my lineage and the wellbeing of the Tibetan people. Great MahÄguru, please tell me these things.â<br/>
He then bowed in deep devotion.</p>
<p>The great Guru replied: âFrom this time on, your royal lineage in TÃ¶ will start to disappear, like fog on a mirror.<br/>
A new king will come, an extraordinary bodhisattva emanation, endowed with the characteristics found in the <em>SÅ«tra of the Fortunate Aeon</em>.<a href="#fn:37" id="fnref:37" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[37]</a><br/>
This freckle-faced king will have dominion over Tibetâs great cities, and the sun of happiness will shine without casting any shadows.<br/>
However, in the horse, sheep and monkey years, a Chinese army will come.<br/>
In the water male monkey year, there will be a military camp at Yarlung.<a href="#fn:38" id="fnref:38" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[38]</a><br/>
Finally, Tibet will be annexed under Chinese rule.<br/>
There will be discord within families and there will be war with mounted cavalry.<br/>
In Bumthang,<a href="#fn:39" id="fnref:39" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[39]</a> there will be defeat in all sectors of the kingdom. </p>
<p>Then an emanation of myself will return to protect the Dharma, right across the empire.<br/>
There will be civil war in Nepal and the sun of happiness will grow dim in Tibet.<br/>
Have no doubt: it is bad conduct that brings forth dark times.<br/>
The times donât change themselves â it is people who change them.<br/>
At this time, beings will not be known for their merit.<br/>
During the day, always pray to me, Pema JungnÃ©.<br/>
Meditate on the Great Compassionate One;<br/>
Direct your hearts to othersâ benefit, recite the <em>maá¹i</em> mantra.<br/>
Show kindness to the six classes of beings, all of them your fathers and mothers.<br/>
At night, meditate on me, Pema JungnÃ©,<br/>
And recite for your own benefit the <em>vajra guru</em> mantra.<br/>
I will protect all sentient beings throughout this degenerate age.<br/>
I will watch over you uninterruptedly, throughout the three times.<br/>
Thus, even if you are reborn in the three lower realms, you will be redeemed.<br/>
Although Iâve shown great kindness to Tibet, beings remain persistently ungrateful.<br/>
Yet, through the power of continuous prayers to me, I will avert all negativity, even at the very worst of times.<br/>
At that darkest of points, an emanation of Maitreya, named TrudÃ¼n will appear, and liberate beings from suffering.<br/>
Once again, times will turn positive and happiness will increase.<br/>
Again and again, beings will have visions of the Buddha.<br/>
Day in and day out, I will come for the benefit of Tibet<br/>
And I will sleep at the door of all those who have faith.<br/>
My human body will never again pass away or take rebirth.<br/>
You, Mutri Tsenpo, will benefit beings for seventeen lifetimes<br/>
And then you will go to Uá¸á¸iyÄna, the land of the á¸ÄkinÄ«s.<br/>
You, Lotsawa Vairocana, must take this profound life story,<br/>
the Dharma of Padma,<br/>
and hide it in the main temple of glorious SamyÃ©,<br/>
to be passed on, in the future, to someone with the right karmic connection. </p>
<p>I cannot stay longer, but must go to tame the <em>raká¹£asas</em>,<br/>
To turn them to the Dharma, without a single exception.<br/>
And so I take my leave,<br/>
Now that Tibet has been established within the Dharma.â </p>
<p>With these words, Padma JungnÃ© turned his gaze to the south-west.</p>
<p><em>Samaya! Seal! Seal!</em></p>
<p><em>I, the treasure revealer Orgyen Lingpa, revealed this treasure from SamyÃ© Chimphu.</em> <a href="#fn:40" id="fnref:40" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[40]</a> <em>Fortunate ones with a karmic connection, keep it close to your heart, this treasure of the profound life and liberation of the Guru Padma! If you read it once â clear, correct and in a pleasant tone â this will be equal to reading the whole of the Pema Kathang.</em> <a href="#fn:41" id="fnref:41" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[41]</a> <em>Sentient beings of this degenerate age have short lives and manifold diseases. They are afflicted by plagues of planetary spirits, nÄgas and gyalpos, which bring hindrances and death. Succumbing to distractions, sentient beings have lost the support and protection of deities and spirits. If you set your mind in alignment with this story of life and liberation, and recite it a hundred or a thousand times, you will find that negativity will decrease and positivity increase.</em></p>
<p><em>Thus, having pacified all adventitious obstacles,<br/>
All evil spirits, all obstructing forces,<br/>
May our bodies become indestructible, like vajras!<br/>
Throughout this life, may all adversities be pacified,<br/>
And in the next, may we be reborn in the realm of Lotus Light!</em></p>
<p><em>The quintessence of this concise Life and Liberation<br/>
Of the Great Orgyen, Pema JungnÃ©,<br/>
Has been put into writing by me, his devoted follower<br/>
In order to benefit both myself and others.</em></p>
<p><em>May the lives of great beings be long!<br/>
May there be an ocean of happiness and bliss!<br/>
May all mother-like beings,<br/>
Starting with my parents,<br/>
Purify their obscurations,<br/>
Perfect the two accumulations,<br/>
Swiftly attain the unexcelled state,<br/>
And be reborn in the sovereign pureland â Lotus Light!</em></p>
<p><em>May virtue increase!</em></p>
